    "# Essential Knowledge:\n",
    "- A variable is an abstraction inside a program that can hold a value. Each variable has associated data storage that represents one value at a time, but that value can be a list or other collection that in turn contains multiple values.\n",
    "- Using meaningful variable names helps with readability of program code and understanding of what values are represented by the variables.\n",
    "- Some programming languages provide types to represent data, which are referenced using variables. These types include numbers, Booleans, lists, and strings.\n",
    "- Some values are better suited to representation using one type of datum rather than another.\n",
    "\n",
    "# What is a variable?\n",
    "- An abstraction inside a program that can hold a value\n",
    "\n",
    "# An example naming variables\n",
    "- You want to store the highest score you scored in a game. So, you want to call this variable highScore\n",
    "- You want to store a name, so you can call the variable firstName\n",
    "- It is also possible to store true or false in a variable. For example, the variable could be called isSunny, where true and false are stored in the variable.\n",
    "- phoneNumber could be a variable that stores phone numbers.\n",
    "- These examples are short and convenient as opposed to a long description\n",
    "- However, they give insight to the basic goal of the variable.\n",
    "- Spaces also cause a problem because it is not allowed\n",
    "- Dashes and numbers are also less ideal.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Data Type examples\n",
    "- highScore --> an integer\n",
    "    - probably doing addition or subtraction, save it as an integer or numbers.\n",
    "- firstName --> text(or string)\n",
    "    - since a name is text, it should be saved as a string\n",
    "- isSunny --> boolean\n",
    "    - only gives two options: true or false within variable\n",
    "- phoneNumber --> text(string)\n",
    "    - no math involved just a string of numbers\n",

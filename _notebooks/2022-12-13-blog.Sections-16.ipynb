    "# Important Notes/Vocab\n",
    "- A simulation is an simpler abstraction of an very complicated natural phenomena\n",
    "- It removes details that are unnecessary or are too difficult to simulate\n",
    "- Simulations make it safer, less expensive, repeatable, and can make predictions\n",
    "- You can remove details that do not matter\n",
    "- The difference between simulations and experiments is that experiments are held in the real world and simulations replicate the real world\n",
    "- A pseudo-random number generator could be used to randomly roll the dice\n",
    "- Simulations can not always be used for situations\n",
    "- Simulations are more of a prediction, while experiments are the actual outcome\n",
    "- An example of removing details from a simulation: when rolling a dice, things like particles in the air and the velocity of the throw are what really determine what you will roll. However simulating that would be unnecessary."

    "- Row 3: I will use data abstraction to allow my code to be as minimal as possible while managing complexity. I will try and use other ways than a list to store my data.\n",
    "- Row 4: The parameters of username, birthday, and password will be set as a result of calling these procedures, but there will not be any output, the data will just be stored.\n",
    "- Row 5: I can implement a selection that can be used to select a good password. If the password is weak it will not be selected and they will have to make a better password.\n",
    "- Row 6: There will be inputs from the user that will be stored and they will use to sign in after they sign up.\n"

    "- The code plan is to first setup the frontend by 2/3 getting all buttons and user input sections displayed to fast pages. Then I will create the databases of each of the users. After I will code the buttons in order to fetch the from the database using fetch in javascript, database with python, and frontend with sass and html. This will take me a couple of weeks  but it will need a lot of planning to make sure that there is there is time to correct error and get perfection. I also want to have enough time to create a confirm password and a password strength checker."

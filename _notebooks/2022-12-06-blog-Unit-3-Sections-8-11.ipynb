    "- For Loop - FOR LOOP repeats a function for a set number of times; I is the number of times repeated\n",
    "- While Loop - The while loop is used to repeat a section of code an unknown number of times until a specific condition is met\n",
    "- Initialization - What sets the counter variable to a starting value. For example (var i = 0) represents an initial value of 0.\n",
    "- Condition - Allows the computer to know whether or not to keep repeating the loop.\n",
    "- Increment/decrement - Modifies the counter variable after each repetition.\n",
    "- Append, remove, pop - Various methods, append adds an element to the end, remove removes at an index, and pop removes the last item."

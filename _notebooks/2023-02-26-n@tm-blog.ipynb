    "This event took place on February 16, 2023 and my group and I arrived at 6:20 because our presenting time was at 6:30 and we wanted to have time to set up. Once we were all ready we walked around for a little bit and looked at some of the other groups projects, but when 6:30 came we all sat down and got ready to present. When the time came, Caleb had to take care of something, so he was not ready, but we still continued on. We presented to mostly parents and a few other students. Some of the parents and students just listened, while some of them asked questions like, \"how are you generating these locations?\" and, \"what is it deployed through?\". We tried waiting for Caleb, but it was getting too close to the end, so we just decided to present and Mr.Yeung and everything went well and I think he liked it. Caleb was able to show up right at the end and he was able to present to Mr.Yeung. Once our time period was up (7:00), we walked around and looked at other CSP projects, 3D animation, photography, and ceramics."

    "Once the clock struck 7:00 I went around and started too look at other projects like 3D Animation, Photography, Ceramics, and other CSP projects. I was very impressed by the other students in the other CSP classes that they were so capable of doing some of the things they did. The 3D animation was also very impressive to me because some of them had so much detail that it seemed impossible to recreate. Some of the photography photos didnt even look real, which surprised me. Once I saw how good some of the other CSP projects were, it inspired me to make mine even better.\n",

    "### What will you learn?\n",
    "\n",
    "You will learn how to determine the value of a variable as a result of an assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Essential Knowledge\n",
    "\n",
    "- The assignment operater allows a program to change the value represented to a variable. \n",
    "- The exam reference sheet uses the \"⟵\" to use for assignment. For example,\n",
    "Text: a ⟵ expression\n",
    "Then the code would display a block text of \"a ⟵ expression\". The code will evaluate expression and then assigns a copy of the result to the variable a. \n",
    "- The value stored in a variable will be the most recent value assigned. For example,\n",
    "\n",
    "    - a ⟵ 1\n",
    "    - a ⟵ b\n",
    "    - a ⟵ 2\n",
    "\n",
    "      display(b)\n",
    "\n",
    "The code will display 1. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Storing Values\n",
    "\n",
    "When storing values, you assign them to a variable. \n",
    "\n",
    "Examples: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. highScore ⟵ 100\n",
    "\n",
    "- The highScore is my assignment operator and it is storing the value of 100 inside itself as a variable. This will set my highScore to 100. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. firstName ⟵ \"Ashley\"\n",
    "\n",
    "- The firstName is the variable and the text we are storing inside is \"Ashley.\" We know that the name is in text because of the quotation marks around the assignment. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. isRaining ⟵ true\n",
    "\n",
    "- The isRaining variable has the intention to be a Boolean variable which checks true or false, but it's been assigned to store the value true.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. phoneNumber ⟵ \"555-0101\"\n",
    "\n",
    "- The phoneNumber variable and the number we are storing is \"555-0101\" The number is written within text because we are not planning to do math with this number. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Additional Vocabulary \n",
    "\n",
    "Elements: individual value in a list that is assigned a unique index. And elements are referenced by an index.\n",
    "\n",
    "Index: referencing elements in a list or string using natural numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "## Interaction\n",
    "\n",
    "### What will we do?\n",
    "\n",
    "We will discuss to see how changing the order of the display can mess with the outcome. This interaction will be done at the end of the lesson when one of our groups team members will call up your table.\n",

    "3. because the first three statements assign values to the variables. Since num1 < num2 evaluates to false, the body of the ELSE block is executed and num3 is assigned the value 4. Since num2 ≥ num3 evaluates to true, the body of the second IF block is executed and num1 is assigned the value 8. Lastly, sum is assigned the value of 8 + 4 + 4, or 16.\n",

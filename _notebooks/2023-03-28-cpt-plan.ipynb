    "- We plan to create a website that tracks basketball statistics for players and teams, providing detailed analysis and insights into performance. We will use advanced data collection methods, including tracking player movements, shots, and other key metrics, to create comprehensive reports and visualizations. We might also offer customized solutions for specific needs, such as player scouting or game strategy optimization. Overall we want to track individual player statistics that can be used to predict their performance in their next game, which can help sports bettors."

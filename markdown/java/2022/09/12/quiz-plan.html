<a class="anchor" href="#my-quiz-plan" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>My quiz plan:</h1>

<ul>
  <li>Create a quiz similar to the example that was more complex
(so I can understand the program)</li>
  <li>Think
(What will make my website different))</li>
  <li>Create
(Use what I know from the lesson and the brainstorm plan to create what website I had in mind)</li>
  <li>Check/ Ask
(Ask teacher and classmates if anything needs to be added or changed)</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="drafting">
<a class="anchor" href="#drafting" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Drafting:</h1>

<p>For my code I used a simple repeating command “on event (“Button name”,”click”, function(){“
    (This was used throughout my whole quiz)
I wanted to create a question that requires them to type in the answer (code below)</p>

<p>onEvent(“enter”, “click”, function( ) {
    console.log(“answerbutton entered text: “ + getText(“text-input”));
    if (getText(“text-input”) == “Ronaldo”) {
      setScreen(“end”);
    } else {
      setScreen(“incorrect”);
    }
});</p>

<h1 id="data-abstraction">
<a class="anchor" href="#data-abstraction" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Data Abstraction</h1>

<p>An example of Data Abstraction in this program is the “font size” chart. It holds multiple selections that represent different sizes. A random number function takes a random size selection from the list and sets the default font size to that selection.</p>

<h1 id="the-point">
<a class="anchor" href="#the-point" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The point</h1>

<p>The point of the assignment was to get comfortable with code.org but specifically java script.</p>

<p># Managing Complexity</p>

<p>An example of complexity management in this quiz is the layout. The quiz is divided into two parts: pasword and exploration in the program. This can easily be seen in the first part of the code, each command has its own defined function.</p>

<h1 id="challenges">
<a class="anchor" href="#challenges" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Challenges</h1>

<p>Since I created a Jeopardy game there were lots of buttons that I had to create so I had to make sure the names were correct, so I could easily find them, I also had a little trouble while making a question with text entry.</p>

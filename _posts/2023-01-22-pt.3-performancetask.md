The procedure starts by moving a newly spawned clone to a random x position within the screen and a random height within a range specified by the ‘y1’ and ‘y2’ parameters. Then, a loop begins until either the game ends or the clone touches the hook. Inside the loop, there is an if-else statement where if the clone touches the edge of the right side of the screen, the clone would teleport left to a position specified by the ‘rt state’ (return state) and to random height within a range specified by ‘y1’ and ‘y2’ parameters.</td>

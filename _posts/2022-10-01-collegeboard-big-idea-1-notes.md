<li>Effective collaboration produces a computing innovation that reflects the diversity of talents and perspectives of those who designed it</li>
<li>A computing inoovation can be a program and it can be physical or nonphysical</li>
<li>Collaboration that includes diverse perspectives helps to aviod bias</li>

<li>The purpose of computing innovation is to solve problems or to puruse interests through creative expression</li>
<li>An understanding of the purpose of a computing innovation provides developers with an imporved ability to develop that computing innovation</li>
<li>Categories of Innovations:</li>
<li><ul>
<li>Applications (things you can download)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><ul>
<li>Physical Devices (devices you can use)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><ul>
<li>Systems (things you can do online like E-mail)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Describing the purpose of a computing is important (essential questions)</p>
</li>
<li><p>Progam inputs are data sent to a computer for processing by a program. Input can come in a variety of forms, such ad tactile, audio, and visual, or text</p>
</li>
<li>An event is associated with an action and supplies input data to a program</li>
<li>Events can be generated when a key is pressed, a mouse is clicked, a program is started, or any other defined action occurs that affects the flow of execution</li>
<li>Inputs usually affect the output produced by a program</li>
<li>Program output can come in a variety of forms, such as tactile, audio, visual, or text</li>
<li>Program output is usually base on a program's input or prior state (e.g., internal values)</li>
<li>Smart phone/tablet, laptop computer, and gaming consle are receive input and present output</li>
<li>Programs receive input from events that are triggered by some action (mouse clicks, button clicks, keyboard entries, audio trigger, ect)</li>
<li>Input does not always affect output</li>
<li><p>Certian lines of code are executed depending on the event (doesn't have to be in order)</p>
</li>
<li><p>A program is a collection of program statements that performs a specific task when run by a computer. A program is often referred to as software</p>
</li>
<li>A code segment is a collection of program statements that is part of a program</li>
<li>A program needs to work for a variety of inputs and situations</li>
<li>The behavior of a program is how a program functions during execution and is often described by how a user interacts with it</li>
<li>A program can be described broadly by what it does, or in more detail by both what the program does and how the program statements accomplish the function</li>
<li>A program is a collection of statements</li>
<li>A statement is a single command and a group of statements is called a code segment</li>
<li>You should be able to state what the code segment does</li>
</ul>

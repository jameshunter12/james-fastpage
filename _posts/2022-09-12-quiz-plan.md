# My quiz plan:
 
-  Create a quiz similar to the example that was more complex
(so I can understand the program)
-  Think
(What will make my website different))
-  Create
(Use what I know from the lesson and the brainstorm plan to create what website I had in mind)
-  Check/ Ask
(Ask teacher and classmates if anything needs to be added or changed)
 
# Drafting:
 
For my code I used a simple repeating command "on event ("Button name","click", function(){"
    (This was used throughout my whole quiz)
I wanted to create a question that requires them to type in the answer (code below)

onEvent("enter", "click", function( ) {
    console.log("answerbutton entered text: " + getText("text-input"));
    if (getText("text-input") == "Ronaldo") {
      setScreen("end");
    } else {
      setScreen("incorrect");
    }
});
 
# Data Abstraction
 
An example of Data Abstraction in this program is the "font size" chart. It holds multiple selections that represent different sizes. A random number function takes a random size selection from the list and sets the default font size to that selection.
 
# The point
 
 The point of the assignment was to get comfortable with code.org but specifically java script.
 
 # Managing Complexity
 
 An example of complexity management in this quiz is the layout. The quiz is divided into two parts: pasword and exploration in the program. This can easily be seen in the first part of the code, each command has its own defined function.

# Challenges

Since I created a Jeopardy game there were lots of buttons that I had to create so I had to make sure the names were correct, so I could easily find them, I also had a little trouble while making a question with text entry.

<h2 id="What-I-Can-Improve">What I Can Improve<a class="anchor-link" href="#What-I-Can-Improve"> </a></h2><p>I did solid on the collaboration  and program design and development quiz, but I could dfeinity do better on progeam function and purpose quiz.</p>
<p>I need to improve in most of the aspects. I think I can start with improving my vocab because if I understand the vocab then it will make everything a lot easier. If I know the vocab then I can easy tell what the question is asking</p>
<p>I need to go through each lesson to review my understanding because right now I am confused on a lot of topics</p>
<p>I haven't taken much notes as of now because I forgot to, so once I start taking notes on chapter 1 I think i will greatly imporve my understanding and clear up any confusion</p>

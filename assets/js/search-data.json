            "content": "Summary of N@TM . This event took place on February 16, 2023 and my group and I arrived at 6:20 because our presenting time was at 6:30 and we wanted to have time to set up. Once we were all ready we walked around for a little bit and looked at some of the other groups projects, but when 6:30 came we all sat down and got ready to present. When the time came, Caleb had to take care of something, so he was not ready, but we still continued on. We presented to mostly parents and a few other students. Some of the parents and students just listened, while some of them asked questions like, &quot;how are you generating these locations?&quot; and, &quot;what is it deployed through?&quot;. We tried waiting for Caleb, but it was getting too close to the end, so we just decided to present and Mr.Yeung and everything went well and I think he liked it. Caleb was able to show up right at the end and he was able to present to Mr.Yeung. Once our time period was up (7:00), we walked around and looked at other CSP projects, 3D animation, photography, and ceramics. . Projects from Other Classes . Once the clock struck 7:00 I went around and started too look at other projects like 3D Animation, Photography, Ceramics, and other CSP projects. I was very impressed by the other students in the other CSP classes that they were so capable of doing some of the things they did. The 3D animation was also very impressive to me because some of them had so much detail that it seemed impossible to recreate. Some of the photography photos didnt even look real, which surprised me. Once I saw how good some of the other CSP projects were, it inspired me to make mine even better. -Below are some of the photos I took and what I thought about them. . Projects from CSP . . This game is called cooler math games and there are various math games you can chose from | They had a minesweeper game, tic tac toe, and a select your own game | I thought this was interesting because my group and the other groups in my period didn&#39;t do games, so I thought this one stood out | I also liked the leaderboard they had | . . This one caught my eye because I am interested into stocks | Their website had parts where you could open charts of the stock and they had a page where it told you the percent the stock was up or down | They also had a game that I thought was interesting where you got a certain amount of money you could use | They used an api that generated different stocks | . 3D Animation . . This 3D animation project had a whole kitche, which I though was unique | The coffee and the donut still stood out even with the whole kitchen, which I thought was good | I thought it was very impressive that they even included the backyard through the window | I also liked the person they added washing their hands | . Photography . . This photo featured a lit up building in the night down by the water | This one stood out to me because of lights that outlined the building | I also think the reflection off of the water made this photo a lot more unique | This photo reminded me of something I would see on my windows laptop before I log in (like a featured photo) | . Final Thoughts . I really enjoyed my expericne at the N@TM because it was very interesting seeing what the other students in CSP created and what the students om the other classes have been working on this trimester. I thought it was interesting what the other groups in CSP came up with because so many poeple had different and unique ideas and I enjoyed looking at the games people created. The art and cool to see and the photography was very cool because so many people had photos in different settings. Overall I would recomend going if you like looking at art work and student created projects. .",

Review the license types in relationship to this Tech Talk and make some notes in your personal blog. . The license that my group decided to use was the MIT license and the Apache license because we felt it would fit our group the best. The MIT license is good because it allows free use and it very flexible. We also used the Apache license because it made for collaboration and on this project we need that, it also allows free use and it allows the users to build upon their work. Overall the MIT and Apache license are pretty similar. MIT and GPL are both open-source licenses, but they have different goals and restrictions. Both of the licenses are accessible to all, but the difference is if you are looking for more protection of users rights then GPL is the better option, but if you are looking for more flexibility MIT is the better option. | . In your blog, summarize the discussions and personal analysis on Software Licenses/Options, Digital Rights, and other Legal and Ethical thoughts from this College Board topic. . Software licenses: There are various distinct kinds of software licenses, including proprietary licenses, copyleft licenses (GPL), and permissive licenses (like the MIT License and Apache License). The project&#39;s objectives and the software&#39;s intended use will determine the license to use. | Digital rights: The era of technology has brought both new difficulties and chances for defending the rights of users and authors. For software developers, enterprises, and consumers alike, issues including copyright, patent law, and data privacy are becoming more and more significant. | Legal and ethical issues: When creating and publishing software, many different legal and ethical issues must be taken into account. These could relate to things like data protection, consumer privacy, and intellectual property rights. | . Make a license for your personal (blog) and Team repositories for the CPT project. Be sure to have a license for both Team GitHub repositories (frontend/backend). Document license(s) you picked and why. FYI, frontend, since it is built on GitHub pages may come with a license and restrictions. Document in blog how team made license choice and process of update. .

The MIT license is good because it allows free use and it very flexible. We also used the Apache license because it made for collaboration and on this project we need that, it also allows free use and it allows the users to build upon their work. Overall the MIT and Apache license are pretty similar. For my personal (blog) I decided to use MIT because I wanted to have a lot of freedom. This license also does not have many restrictions, which allows me be more flexible. I wanted a simple and straightfoward license that is easy to understand and one that gets the job done. | . Big Idea 5.6 Safe Computing . Describe PII you have seen on project in CompSci Principles. . PII I have seen in the projects in CompSci are login and user information. This can consist of usernames and passwords created by the users, which typically contain important information. I have also seen location as apart of PII. For our porject we are a house renting service in San Diego, so location is important. | . What are your feelings about PII and your personal exposure? . I feel that PII and my personal exposure is very important because that type of information is very important to me as a person and that information is apart of my identity. This is why I try and make sure I can make my account as secure as possible, with things like 2FA. I also try and look out for potiential viruses or links that could expose my personal data. | . Describe good and bad passwords? What is another step that is used to assist in authentication. . Good passwords are ones that contain at least 8-12 characters, ones that contain special characters, numbers, and upper and lowercase letters. The good passwords are typically complex. A bad password on the other hand is a password that is esay to guess, short, doesn&#39;t contain any special characters, and contains the users name. Another step to assist in authentication is 2FA. 2FA keeps a certian code on file or generates a code and then sends it user. The user must use this code in order to login into their account, so people who do not have access to the email or phone number cannot get in. | . Try to describe Symmetric and Asymmetric encryption. . With Symmetric encryption only one key is used to both encrypt and decrypt electronic information. With Asymmetric encryption there are two keys: one public key and one private key, that are used to to protect a message from unauthorized access or use. | . Provide an example of encryption we used in AWS deployment. . AWS provides a key management service, AWS Key Management Service (KMS), which can allow to easily control and securely store your encryption keys. | . Describe a phishing scheme you have learned about the hard way. Describe some other phishing techniques. . I have never actually learned about phishing the hard way or at least I cant remember a time I learned about phishing the hard way. I am very cautious when it comes to my personal information, so I stay away from random links that are texted to me and random emails that I recieve. I also use an ad blocker some times to limit the chances of me falling for something. Type of phishing technique that I have encountered is when a random phone number sends you a text message and says you have a reward to claim and you have to click on the link they sent to claim that reward and then when you click on the link your information can be given away. | .",

Google “What age groups use Facebook” vs “… TikTok”? I think the data shows that Facebook is used by an older audience while TikTok is used by a younger audience, but they both have a good amount of users in the 20-30 year old category. I think this datt makes sense because Tiktok is directed at a younger audience due to its bright colors and dancing trends, while Facebook is directed towards at a older audience due to it duller colors and it has been around longer. | Why do virtual assistants have female voices? Amazon, Alexa Google, Apple Siri. I think that virtual assistants have female voices because they are trying to represent a mother and mothers usually symbolize comfort. Female voices can also be perceived as friendly and helpful and people potentially could just prefer female voices as they tend to be more comforting. | Talk about an algorithm that influences your decisions, think about these companies (ie FAANG - Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, Google) I think most of these companies specifically Amazon they track what you search and then they provide products that are similar to what you have been looking at. I also do feel other companies do the same thing, it might not be what you search, but really anything you interact with (ex: liking a post and then it will give you similar posts to the one you liked) | Does the owner of the computer think this was intentional? No I do not think the owner of the computer did this intentionally. I think this happened because when they were testing the camera they tried it on little to no people of color. It is harmful because the camera may not work for everyone, but I don&#39;t think they meant to do thim. I think this should be corrected and to do that they should try it on people of color, so then they know it works for everyone. | . Big Idea 5.4 Crowdsourcing . CompSci has 150 ish principles students. Describe a crowdsource idea and how you might initiate it in our environment? . Since we are working on our projects we can create a survey that people can fill out anonymously and provide feedback and suggest changes that could make someones project better. Another idea is we can create a website that everyone can work on and sumbit their own ideas and then collaborate with others to develop the idea. | . What about Del Norte crowdsourcing? Could your project be better with crowdsourcing? . We can use Del Norte students and staff to come up with ideas that could make the school a better place and we could also find things people don&#39;t like about the school and fix those problems. Our project could be better with crowdsourcing because if we ask other people about things they don&#39;t like then we can change them. We can also ask people about what places they like to vacation (we are a hosue renting service,) so then our project can actually be used to help people. | . What kind of data could you capture at N@tM to make evening interesting? Perhaps use this data to impress Teachers during finals week. . At the N@tM I think it would be important to collect how important our project is to each person on a scale of 1-10. With this data we can show how our project can be useful in the real world or how it would not be useful. This also provides us with feedback and the thoughts of others outside of our group. | .",

            "content": "My Score . My Corrections . My answer is wrong because mine is not multplying by 3 the command that says repeat 3 times indicates multiplication and I used addition. This is also in correct because iff the value of y was 2, the inner loop would repeat two times and the outer loop would repeat three times. The statement result &lt; result + 1 would be executed 3 times 2, or six times. When y = 2, the value of y + 3 is 5, not 6. . My answer is wrong because eventually the loop will reach 7 wheras with 6 it won&#39;t because the number is always going to be odd. This is also incorrect because the value of the variable j starts at 1 and increases by 2. If &lt; MISSING CONDITION &gt; is replaced with the expression j = 7, the expression will evaluate to true when j is 7 and the loop will end. . The robot can only be in one of four squares in the grid, given that p is a positive integer. These squares include the starting position, two squares above facing up, two squares above and two to the right facing right, or two to the right facing left. The position depicted is not a possible final location. . I got part of the question correct, but B is not correct because it will not get the robot to the gray square, but C will, so the answers are A and C. A is correct because with each iteration of the Repeat 4 times loop, the robot will move one square to the left and one square up and will remain facing up. After four of these iterations, the robot will finish in the gray square. . A is wrong because it should draw the circle after the radius and y value is adjusted, this is also why B is correct. D has the same error it draws the circle before the y and r values are adjusted, which is why C is correct, so the 2 answers are C and B. . A is incorrect because only at some times value will be 2 and make the procedure true, but everytime the number is going to be even, which is why C is correct. A is also incorrect because if the initial value of number is 4, the REPEAT UNTIL loop will reduce the value of number to 2, and then to 0, at which point the loop will terminate. The procedure will return true, not false. . C is not correct because there is no way for the robot to end above the starting position (it either goes left or right,) which is why B must be correct. It is also incorrect because the robot turns right one, two, or three times and could end up in a square to the left of its initial position. It cannot end up in a square above its initial position. . This question was confusing and I did not really understand what they were asking for, but I put B and C and the answers were A and D. According to college board the answer is not B becuase, The statement Random (1, 5) could evaluate to 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5. There is a two out of five, or 40 percent, chance that it could evaluate to 1 or 2. If this happens, the value of sum is increased by 1, which simulates a person voting for the candidate. This does not match the goal of the program, which is to simulate an election in which a certain candidate is expected to receive 20 percent of the vote. . Answer B is incorrect (interchanging line 5 and line 6) because since they are both inside of FOR EACH loop interchanging them will not affect the number of operations performed. Answer D is correct (interchanging line 7 and line 8) because then you will be able to find the final average instead of having it keep repeating and getting different averages. .",

How does someone empower themself in a digital world? . Having a set of digital skills can be very beneficial. In the digital world if you have digital skills it can lead to you having job advantages and better communication.

Being involved in the digital world can allow you to stay up to date with digital trends and it can allow you to access new opportunities. | . How does someone that is empowered help someone that is not empowered? Describe something you could do at Del Norte HS. . Someone that is empowered can help someone that is not empowered by becoming almost like a mentor for them by teaching and showing their skills, so that person that is not empowered will be able to become empowered. At Del Norte HS I can teach some of the people about APCSP and show they how the skills I am learning can be very useful in the real world and how them can empower someone. | . Is paper or red tape blocking digital empowerment? Are there such barriers at Del Norte? Elsewhere? . I think paper in some ways is blocking digital empowerment because people that have grown up with paper are going to be more inclined to use paper over technology. There are also some other things that are blocking digital empowerment like the expense of it and the limited access some people have. I dont think there are such barriers at Del Norte because almost every student at one point was working online during covid, so everyone has had some experience with technology. Also for the people that have a hard time accessing technology at Del Norte stduents are able to get their own chromebooks. On the other hand some people may not be as fortunate, so I do see the expense of technology blocking digital empowerment. | .",

Reporting Category Student Score College Board Score Comments &lt;/tr&gt; Program Purpose and Function | 1 | 1 | The video shows a program that allows the user to input their choice of rock, paper, or scissors and the computer will randomly select one as well. The output will show the result of the match and give the user the option to play again. The program&#39;s purpose is to make a decision. | . Data Abstraction | 0 | 0 | Two code segments are shown, one storing data in a list named RPS, and the other does not access the data. The data stored in the list are the options that the computer can select as its input. | . Managing Complexity | 0 | 0 | The response explains that the program can be written without using a list by setting the variable &quot;cpuPlay&quot; using an if statement based on a random number, but it would not affect the complexity or ease of development/maintenance of the program. | . Procedural Abstraction | 0 | 0 | The response includes a student-developed procedure, &quot;rpsGame&quot;, which takes one parameter, &quot;yourPlay&quot; and uses it in a series of if-else statements to output a result based on both user&#39;s and computer&#39;s inputs. The procedure contributes to the overall program by allowing for smooth execution, but it does not specify how. | . Algorithm Implementation | 1 | 1 | The response explains that the student-developed algorithm within procedure, &quot;rpsGame&quot;, includes sequencing, selection (if statement), and iteration through use of recursion. The algorithm randomly selects an item from a list, saves it in a variable &quot;cpuPlay&quot;, displays the computer&#39;s choice, compares it with the user&#39;s input through a series of if-else statements, prints the result, and offers the user to play again. If the user inputs &quot;Yes&quot; the function is called again, if the user inputs &quot;No&quot; the computer prints &quot;Goodbye&quot;. | . Testing | 1 | 1 | The response describes two calls to the procedure with different arguments, leading to different results. The conditions being tested for the two procedure calls are if the user&#39;s input is equal to &quot;Rock&quot; and the computer&#39;s input is &quot;Paper&quot; in the first case and if the user&#39;s input is equal to &quot;Paper&quot; and the computer&#39;s input is &quot;Rock&quot; in the second case. If the conditions are true, the function displays &quot;You Lose!&quot; in the first case and &quot;You Win...&quot; in the second case. | . . Submission 2 . Reporting Category Student Score College Board Score Comments &lt;/tr&gt; Program Purpose and Function | 1 | 1 | The video shows a program that helps users recognize new words and expand their vocabulary. The user inputs letters into a text field, the program outputs the letter in the correct spot of the randomly generated word or reduces the number of lives if the letter is not found, and shows a winning screen if the word is completed. Input includes letters, numbers, symbols and multiple letters in a single guess. | . Data Abstraction | 1 | 1 | Two code segments are provided, the first one stores data in a list named letOfGuessWord, and the second one accesses the data from the list in a for loop. The list holds the individual letters of the word that the user is trying to guess. | . Managing Complexity | 1 | 1 | The response includes a code that uses a list to manage complexity by storing the letters of the word to be guessed. The list is scanned based on its length, which allows for implementation of longer words. The response explains that if the program were to run without the list, it would be inefficient and more complicated as it would require 5 new variables to store individual letters and a for loop to check for a match between the user&#39;s input and the word. | . Procedural Abstraction | 1 | 1 | The response includes a student-developed procedure, &quot;guessWords&quot; which takes a parameter and uses it to compare the user&#39;s input to the letters of the randomly generated word. If the user&#39;s input matches the letter, it will display the letter in the correct spot and if the program does not find the letter in the word, it will take a life away from the user. The procedure contributes to the overall functionality of the program by doing the work of comparing the letters and determining the result. | . Algorithm Implementation | 1 | 1 | The student-developed algorithm within procedure, &quot;guessWords&quot;, includes sequencing, selection (if statement), and iteration (for loop). The algorithm uses a for loop to loop through the entire list by the length of the word that the user is trying to guess, then uses an if statement to compare the letter that the user inputted to all of the letters in the randomly generated word. If the if statement condition is true, it sets the letter that the user inputted to the index of where the letter was found in the randomly generated word, sets a boolean &quot;check&quot; to true, and adds 1 to &quot;count&quot; to keep track of how many times the user has guessed a letter correctly. | . Testing | 1 | 1 | The response describes two different calls to a procedure that results in different code being executed. The user inputs the number &quot;1&quot; and the letter &quot;h&quot; when the word to be guessed is &quot;hello&quot;. The conditions being tested are the number &quot;1&quot; not being found in &quot;hello&quot; and the letter &quot;h&quot; being found in &quot;hello&quot;. The results of the two calls are false for the first call and true for the second call. | . . Submission 3 . Reporting Category Student Score College Board Score Comments &lt;/tr&gt; Program Purpose and Function | 1 | 1 | The video shows an app that helps with memorization or learning something new by displaying general information, such as the state flag, area, and population, of a selected state from a drop-down list, and allowing the user to select more information. The input is the selected state and the chosen information, the output is the general information and the selected information displayed on the screen. | . Data Abstraction | 0 | 0 | Two code segments are provided, the second one shows data being stored in a list named stateList, containing all the information the user will see on the general information screen like State name, Flag, Population, Capital, and Population. However, the code fragment provided only shows the state name stored in the list. | . Managing Complexity | 0 | 0 | The response includes code that uses lists to manage complexity, but it does not explain how the code would be more complex or inefficient without them. The response states that it would take a long time and be inefficient without the use of a list. | . Procedural Abstraction | 0 | 0 | The response includes a student-developed procedure &quot;updateScreen&quot; but it does not have any parameter and it is not called in the second code segment. The response describes the procedure inaccurately as it does not update the state screen but only sets an index and does not explain how it contributes to the overall functionality of the program. | . Algorithm Implementation | 0 | 0 | The response partially explains the algorithm in the procedure &quot;updateScreen&quot; which includes sequencing and selection using if/else statements, but does not include iteration. The algorithm uses else if statements to narrow down the user&#39;s selected state and sets the index value based on the match, but the response does not explain the specific value set for each U.S. state. | . Testing | 0 | 0 | The response describes two calls from the specified procedure, but it is not an implicit parameter, it is assigned after the call is made. It describes the two separate operations the user performs, not the conditions being tested by the given parameter. The response does not specify the results of the two calls, but the results that appear on the screen. | . . Submission 4 . Reporting Category Student Score College Board Score Comments &lt;/tr&gt; Program Purpose and Function | 1 | 1 | The video demonstrates a program that allows the user to control a boat&#39;s movement and catch fish, with the purpose of lessening boredom. The input is the user pressing keys &#39;a&#39; and &#39;d&#39; and the output is the boat&#39;s left and right movement. The video also includes scorekeeping for total score and tracking the amount of each fish caught in time. | . Data Abstraction | 1 | 1 | The response explains that a list called fishtypes is used to store information about the types of fish caught, and the number of each type caught. The code also shows that this data is accessed in a for loop. | . Managing Complexity | 1 | 1 | The response includes a list of lists that manages complexity by storing fish data, including type and number caught. The response explains that the code can be written without lists by creating new variables for each added fish, but this would be less efficient and would require more changes to the program. | . Procedural Abstraction | 1 | 1 | The response includes a student-developed procedure, &quot;clone+movement+range,&quot; that uses five parameters. The procedure determines where a clone of a sprite spawns, how far it can move, and where it goes when it reaches the end of the screen. The procedure makes the game more challenging by causing each fish clone to spawn and move randomly at a range of speeds or height. | . Algorithm Implementation | 1 | 1 | The response describes a procedure called &quot;clone+movement+range&quot; which uses sequencing, selection, and iteration to determine the spawning, movement, and end positions of a clone sprite. The procedure starts by moving a newly spawned clone to a random x position within the screen and a random height within a range specified by the ‘y1’ and ‘y2’ parameters. Then, a loop begins until either the game ends or the clone touches the hook. Inside the loop, there is an if-else statement where if the clone touches the edge of the right side of the screen, the clone would teleport left to a position specified by the ‘rt state’ (return state) and to random height within a range specified by ‘y1’ and ‘y2’ parameters. | . Testing | 0 | 0 | The response does not specify the arguments passed to the procedure and how they affect the procedure&#39;s behavior. Instead, it explains alternative coding segments that could be used. The response describes conditions being tested, but it does not correspond to how the parameters are used in the program. The response also describes the code segments rather than the result of the procedure call. | . .",

In Python, a database can be constructed using the foundations we learned in modeling a Class. . A &quot;Table&quot; is a Model/Schema within a Database. | A &quot;Table&quot; definition in Python/SQLAlchemy is manifested by defining a &quot;Class&quot; and &quot;Attributes&quot; in Python. | A Python Class can inherit database functionality from SQLAlchemy.

Hacks . The Big Picture purpose of this hack is to build a database. Being able to create an SQLite table and populate test data within it is the major goal. To do this effectively it is imperative to show the following. . Build Schema for a table, make a new model file and use users.py as an example. Start slow and simple and build up. | Build an initXXXXX() method and use it to add preliminary/test data to the table. Once again use users.py as an example. | Make a 30-60 second video where you show a Debugging session of making new rows in the table. Use sqlite marketplace tools and/or sqlite3 command line tool to show success in creating table and adding data. | Hack Helper . Here are some tips. . Become familiar with initUsers(). Observe it is called/activated from main.py. This function activates after you run the main.py and activate the web application in the browser. Observe that the sqlite.db file will appear in the volumes directory in conjunction with home screen of site appearing in browser. . | Delete sqlite.db from volumes directory on your development machine. Set breakpoint on initUsers() and run main.py using debug. Use the step into option on the debugger and observe the creation of data. . | . @app.before_first_request def activate_job():initJokes() initUsers() . Make your own XXXXX.py file under model directory. Follow users.py and develop your own schema from the OOP code you did in last Hacks. Follow the pattern in users.py to make a initXXXX() function top populate some test data. . | In main.py, add your initXXXX() method to def activate_job() function shown above. Use this as basis of your video debugging session. Debugging is hugely important at this level to understand your database success prior to building an API. Building initXXXX() method, adding database records, and debugging will enable you to verify CRUD operations as you develop. . | .",

Reporting Category Student Score College Board Score Comments &lt;/tr&gt; Program Purpose and Function | 0 | 0 | The purpose of the program is stated as &quot;for you to see all the animals and to identify them when you&#39;re asked later&quot; but it does not state the problem being solved or creative interest being pursued. The response also does not accurately describe the functionality demonstrated in the video and confuses input and output. | . Data Abstraction | 0 | 0 | Two code segments are provided, one showing storage of data in a list named animalImages, and the other showing another list named animalList. However, animalList is not used in either code segment. The response describes the data contained in animalList, but it also describes the images from animalImages, which are stated to be in the list. | . Managing Complexity | 0 | 0 | The response does not include a program code segment that uses a list to manage complexity. Both code segments show data being stored in a list, but neither contain code using a list. The code is not complex. The response also does not explain how the list manages complexity, it just states that the array allows you to store more than one variable making it shorter and more complex, but it does not explain how it would be written differently without the list. | . Procedural Abstraction | 0 | 0 | The response includes a student-developed procedure called evaluateGuess with one explicit parameter, guess, and a call to this procedure in a second code segment using the argument guess. The response describes the functionality of the procedure as determining if the user&#39;s guess is right or wrong. However, the response does not describe how this procedure contributes to the overall functionality of the program. | . Algorithm Implementation | 0 | 0 | The student-developed algorithm within the procedure, evaluateGuess, includes sequencing, iteration (a for loop) and selection (an if statement). The response provides a minimal description of the algorithm, but it does not provide enough detail for someone to recreate it. | . Testing | 1 | 1 | The first call is for &quot;dog&quot; which is a correct guess. The second call is for &quot;mouse&quot; which is an incorrect guess. The response also describes the conditions being tested in the procedure, which are whether the guess is equal to one of the animals in animalList or not. The response also states the different results of the two calls, the first call results in &quot;You got a point!&quot; and the second call results in &quot;That&#39;s 1 strike.&quot; | . . Submission 2 . Reporting Category Student Score College Board Score Comments &lt;/tr&gt; Program Purpose and Function | 1 | 1 | The purpose of the program is specified as to explore the user&#39;s creativity through the expression of poetry using their words. The response also describes the functionality, showing the poems according to the user&#39;s inputs of words and setting of articles, resulting in multiple different poems with different word orders and another generation of poems with different words and no articles. The response also describes the input and output of the program. | . Data Abstraction | 1 | 1 | Two code segments are provided, the first shows data being stored in a list named nounList and the second shows the data being accessed from the list under a new name, wordList, since it is passed as a parameter. The response identifies what is stored in the list, stating that the data contains nouns that must be in certain specific locations within the poem to make logical sense. | . Managing Complexity | 1 | 1 | The response includes code that uses lists of words to manage complexity when generating poetry. It mentions that without the list, the noun inputs would have to be stored in different variables and would have to be invoked separately. Another method would have to be used to randomize selection such as generating a random integer, which would require writing individual statements for each possible int generated and making the code more cluttered. | . Procedural Abstraction | 1 | 1 | The response includes a student-developed procedure called createPoems, with four parameters that are used in the procedure. The response also describes how the procedure contributes to the overall program by stating that it is used in conjunction with the user inputs and builds poems according to how many poems the user specified and whether the user wanted articles in the poems. | . Algorithm Implementation | 1 | 1 | The student-developed algorithm within the procedure, createPoems, includes sequencing, selection (if statement), and iteration (while loop). The response explains in detail how the algorithm works, it sequentially first defines a variable to count the number of poems generated and defines an empty string, then it has iteration that generates as many poems as the user specified by running through the selection statements which call articlePoem or noArticlePoem each time. | . Testing | 1 | 1 | The response describes two calls to a specific procedure, createPoems, that result in different code being executed by varying the argument for the last parameter. The first call is createPoems(nounList, verbList, adverbList, 1) and the second call is createPoems(nounList, verbList, adverbList, 0). The last parameter represents the article preference setting. The response describes the conditions being tested by the code, which are whether the user input is 1 or 0 for the article preference setting. | . . Submission 3 . Reporting Category Student Score College Board Score Comments &lt;/tr&gt; Program Purpose and Function | 1 | 0 | The video demonstrates a program that allows the user to select two Marvel characters from a drop-down menu, displaying their rankings and the winner of the battle using an image. The response describes the program&#39;s function, functionality demonstrated in the video, input and output. The response describes the input as the different button clicks to change the screens and the character names selected from each drop-down box. | . Data Abstraction | 1 | 1 | Two code segments are provided, the first showing data being stored in a list named firstCharacterList and the second accessing the data from that list in a loop. The response identifies the data stored in the list as the power rankings and URL for the image of a character selected from a drop-down box. | . Managing Complexity | 1 | 1 | The response includes a list that combines six rankings and an image URL for a character into one collection, managing complexity in the program code. The response explains that the list condenses the code, and without it the program would need more parameters and more steps to find the winner. | . Procedural Abstraction | 1 | 1 | The response describes a procedure called findWinner that compares the average power rankings of two Marvel characters passed as parameters. The procedure changes the winner screen to display the character with the higher average and if the averages are the same, it displays a &quot;tie&quot; image. The procedure contributes to the overall program by determining the hypothetical winner in a battle between characters. | . Algorithm Implementation | 1 | 1 | The student-developed algorithm in the findWinner procedure uses sequencing, selection, and iteration to compare the average power rankings of two characters selected from a drop-down menu. The algorithm iterates through the list of each character, sums up the rankings, and divides by 6 to get the average. It then compares the averages using a conditional statement to determine the winner and display their name and image on the winner screen. | . Testing | 1 | 1 | The response describes two calls to a procedure, findWinner, with different arguments (Vision and Bishop; Carnage and Venom) that lead to different results. The response explains how the procedure uses an if-else statement to determine the winner based on average ranking and displays the winner&#39;s image and name or a tie image. | . . Submission 4 . Reporting Category Student Score College Board Score Comments &lt;/tr&gt; Program Purpose and Function | 1 | 1 | The video demonstrates a program that tests critical thinking skills by collecting input through a text entry field for guessing an 8-letter word, and displays the matching letters. The user inputs words, correctly guessing &quot;touching&quot; in 4 tries, but failing to guess &quot;sandwich&quot; in 6 tries. The input is a word the user inputs, and the output is the color scheme of the corresponding letters. | . Data Abstraction | 0 | 0 | Two code segments are provided, the first shows data being stored in a list named &#39;guesses&#39; but in the second segment, data stored in the list is not being used, only the length of the list is accessed. The response states that the data in the list represents all the user&#39;s word inputs. | . Managing Complexity | 1 | 0 | The response describes a program code segment that uses a list named &quot;guesses&quot; to keep track of the user&#39;s guesses, but the list is not used to manage complexity and can be replaced with a single counter variable. The response does not explain how the list manages complexity and instead mentions that the list&#39;s purpose is to stop the game after 6 guesses. | . Procedural Abstraction | 1 | 1 | The response includes a student-developed procedure, isitcorrect, which compares a user input guess to the correct word or letter positions. The procedure is called in the program with the argument answer. The procedure checks the user&#39;s answer every time they input a guess and contributes to the overall program. | . Algorithm Implementation | 1 | 1 | The response describes a student-developed algorithm called isitcorrect that includes sequencing, selection, and iteration. The algorithm checks if a user&#39;s input is 8 letters, if so it checks for position and accuracy of each letter, turning the output letters green, yellow or red accordingly, it also determines when the &#39;You Win&#39; or &#39;You Lose&#39; screen will show up based on the input. | . Testing | 0 | 0 | The response describes the conditions being tested in a procedure, specifically &quot;whether or not the user inputs the right letter in the right position&quot; and &quot;whether or not the user inputs the right letter in the wrong position.&quot; It also describes the result of these conditions, with the letter color changing to green or yellow respectively. The response does not provide specific arguments used in the procedure call. | . .",

In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), a class is a blueprint for creating an Object. (a data structure). An Object is used like many other Python variables. | A Class has ... a collection of data, these are called Attributes and in Python are pre-fixed using the keyword self | a collection of Functions/Procedures. These are called *Methods when they exist inside a Class definition. | . | An Object is created from the Class/Template. Characteristics of objects ... an Object is an Instance of the Class/Template | there can be many Objects created from the same Class | each Object contains its own Instance Data | the data is setup by the Constructor, this is the &quot;init&quot; method in a Python class | all methods in the Class/Template become part of the Object, methods are accessed using dot notation (object.method()) | . | A Python Class allow for the definition of @ decorators, these allow access to instance data without the use of functions ... @property decorator (aka getter). This enables developers to reference/get instance data in a shorthand fashion (object.name versus object.get_name()) | @name.setter decorator (aka setter). This enables developers to update/set instance data in a shorthand fashion (object.name = &quot;John&quot; versus object.set_name(&quot;John&quot;)) | observe all instance data (self._name, self.email ...) are prefixed with &quot;&quot;, this convention allows setters and getters to work with more natural variable name (name, email ...) | . | .

Data Abstraction | 1 | 1 | Their answer includes 2 program code segments with 1 storing data and the other is a part of fullfilling the programs purpose. They also identify the variable used (startGrid.) They also describe how the data is stored:the status of one of the 10,800(120 x 90) possible cells on screen. A 0 being dead, and a 1 being alive. | . Managing Complexity | 1 | 1 | They use a code segment that manages complexity by using a list to store all of the data in one place. The list makes it easier to keep track of the data and easily change data. The explanation is also very detailed about how the code manages complexity. | . Procedural Abstraction | 1 | 1 | They deserve a 2 because they include a student created procedure with 2 parameters (current and replacement) and they also createcd a code segment that defined what was being call in the above procedure. They also include the functionality of the procedure in the response by saying, &quot;This procedure takes as inputs identifying numbers for two lists. The first will be copied over to replace the second.&quot; | . Algorithm Implementation | 1 | 1 | The student uses sequencing, selection (if statement), and iteration (repeat loop) in their student developed algorithm. Their explanation is good enough to where some one would be able to recreate their code. They state, &quot;The algorithm uses nested if-else statements to identify which list will be copied from, by looking at the first parameter. Inside the if statement matching that parameter, are another set of if statements to determine where the list should be copied over to.&quot; | . .",

There are 4 types of algorithms, 1 step, 2 step, 3 step, and 4 step | An example of a 1 step is: 2 * n | An example of a 2 step is: 2^n | An example of a 3 step is: (2 * n)^2 | An example of a 4 step is: 5! = 5 4 3 2 1 = 120 | There are problems that computers cannot solve | If a computer can solve a problem it may take an unreasonable amount of time | Undecidable problem: problems for which no algorithms can be built that can provide a correct yes or no answer or a solution | Decidable problem: problems for which algorthms could be written to solve/produce a correct output for all inputs. | . HACK 1 . Please write a short 1-2 sentence explanation describing the difference between decidable and undecidable problems. Make sure to provide at least one example of each. . The difference between an decidable problem and an undecidable problem is that an undecidable problem has no algorithms that provide a solution whereas a decidable problem has algorithms that are solutions. | . def ben(): z = 0 i = 1 while z != 1: i = i + 1 print(i) ben() . vardaan = 5 if vardaan &gt; 10: print(&quot;greater than 10&quot;) else: print(&quot;not greater than 10&quot;) . HACK 2 . Which of the following is a 3 step algorithm? . A. 2 x 6 x 8 . B. 4^5 . C. (3 x 8)^2 . This is the answer because there is 3 steps (3 x 8) and then you have to put it to the power of 2, which is another 2 steps (24 x 2 x 2) this makes a total of 3 steps. | . D. None of the above . E. All of the above . HACK 3: Rewrite this JavaScript Code in a More Efficient Way (Hint: Use Binary Search) . function peak_finder(array){ let counter = 0 let peak = 0 let peak_index =0 while (counter &lt;= array.length){ console.log(counter) if (counter === 0){ if (a[0]&gt;=a[1]){ peak = a[0] peak_index = counter counter = array.length return `The ${counter-1} indexed number, ${peak} is a peak` }else{ counter+=1 } }else if(counter === array.length-1){ if (a[array.length-1] &gt;= a[array.length-2]){ peak = a[array.length-1] peak_index = counter counter = array.length return `The ${counter-1} indexed number, ${peak} is a peak` } }else{ if (a[counter]&gt; a[counter+1] &amp;&amp; a[counter]&gt; a[counter-1]){ peak = a[counter] peak_index = counter counter = array.length return `The ${counter-1} indexed number, ${peak} is a peak` }else{ counter += 1 } } } } .

Instead of having all of the extra code I simply used a sort function to sort the data. | . HACK 5: Rewrite this Python Code in a More Efficient Way . from itertools import permutations perm = permutations([1, 2, 3]) for i in list(perm): print (i) . (1, 2, 3) (1, 3, 2) (2, 1, 3) (2, 3, 1) (3, 1, 2) (3, 2, 1) . This version of the function uses an in-place algorithm, which means that it does not create a new list for each permutation. | . Blog/Final Thoughts . Found out there are undecidable problems are | Also found out what a 1 step, 2 step, and 4 step, functions are | These were things that I did not even no about before | For creating the more effiecient code I understood it a little, but it was pretty hard to understand what to do, at least for #3 | Hack 3 and 5 for probably the hardest and 3 was pretty confusing | Also learned how to make code more effective and simplify it | .

The selected names are: Paulo James Ashkon Max Cam . You can with making a list of 15 names and then you create a new list(selected names) that contains 5 random names. Then it prints each name in the selected names list. | . Create a program to simulate a dice game where each player rolls two fair dice (6 sides); the player with the greater sum wins | import random def roll_dice(): die1 = random.randint(1, 6) die2 = random.randint(1, 6) return die1 + die2 num_players = 2 player1 = [&quot;James&quot;] player2 = [&quot;Ben&quot;] for player in player1: print(f&quot;{player1[0]},&quot;) jamesscore = roll_dice() print(f&quot;You rolled {jamesscore} in total!&quot;) for player in player2: print(f&quot;{player2[0]},&quot;) benscore = roll_dice() print(f&quot;You rolled {benscore} in total!&quot;) if jamesscore &gt; benscore: print(&quot;James wins&quot;) else: print(&quot;Ben wins&quot;) . James, You rolled 12 in total! Ben, You rolled 7 in total! James wins . Starts by defining what a dice roll is like the possible outcomes. Then you input player 1 and 2 names and then you run the same section of code for each player that rolls 2 dice and adds the 2 numbers together. Then it compares player 1 to player 2 total score. | .

Indexes: the number that represents an element in a list | Element a integer or string in a list. | Algorithms can be written in different ways and still accomplish the same tasks | Algorithms that appear similar can yield different side effects or results | Some conditional statements can be written as equivalent Boolean expressions | Some Boolean expressions can be written as equivalent conditional statements | Different algorithms can be developed or used to solve the same problem | Algorithms can be created from an idea, by combining existing algorithms, or by modifying existing algorithms. | . 1. Write this Boolean statement in the form of a conditional (if/else) statement: . stayInside⟵((isCold) OR (isRaining)) . { if(isRaining){ stayInside &lt;- true } if(isCold){ stayInside &lt;- true } else { stayInside &lt;- false } } . This code is saying that if it is raining or cold then you stay inside. If it is not cold or rainy then you dont stay inside. | . 2. Create an algorithm that uses selection and/or iteration that will represent one player&#39;s complete turn. . During a turn, each player gets 4 attempts/chances to get the greatest number possible. . | During each attempt, the player will use a random number generator to select a random number from 1 to 10. . | After they have had 4 chances, their score is the greatest number they received from the random number generator, and their turn is over. . | . import random attempts = [] i = 1 while i &lt;= 4: attempts.append(random.randint(1,10)) i = i + 1 print(attempts) print(&quot;Maximum:&quot;, max(attempts)) .

Create an algorithm that will allow the arrow to reach the gray square: . { if canmoveFoward{ moveFoward } else{ canturnRight{ turnRight } canturnLeft{ turnLeft } } } . This code has you move foawrd until you are not able to and then once you can you have to turn right or left. | . 4. Make a binary search tree of different the list [1,2,3,4,6,9,11,69] . This tree starts at 6 and then on each side it does the same process until you get every value. The process is adding the highest and lowest index and then dividing by 2 and then you choose the corresponding number to that index. | . 5. Explain thorughly how to find the number 69 in the list above (use key words) . Using sequential search you would go through the list comparing 69 to every value in the list until the number (69) matches 69. In the order this list is it will take 7 iterations to find 69 | Using binary search you would start in the middle, you can find this by adding the first and last last ((1+8)/2=4.5). You have to round up to 5 for the index, so you start at number 6 in the list. You do this on either side until you get your desired value. (You would want to get 8 because the index of 8 = 69) | . 6. Make a diagram explaining how you found the list (not tree, include equation) . You first want to find the middle so you do that. Once you do that you do the same process again and you get 11, which is the number wanted. | . 7. Put this list of strings in a order that can be used for binary search . Original: [&quot;store&quot;,&quot;Market&quot;,&quot;Walmart&quot;,Target&quot;,&quot;Ralphs&quot;] | Correct Order: [&quot;Market&quot;,&quot;Ralphs&quot;,&quot;store&quot;,&quot;Target&quot;,&quot;Walmart&quot;] | Alphabetical order would be the best way to put it | . 8. Explain why Binary Search is more efficient than Sequential Search . Binary search is more efficient than sequential search because sequential search goes one by one in the list comparing each value to the value you are looking for. Binary search on the other hand basically divides the amount of answers it could be after each step, making it a lot faster to find a certian number in a large list. | . 9. [64,36,16,11,9] Explain which number you are finding, how many check it would take, and make a binary search tree . If I am searching for 36 it would take 2 checks. You would start at 16 because it is the middle index. Then you would do 1 + 3 = 4 and then divide by 2 to get 2 for the index. Index 2 is the number 36, so we would stop there. | . Blog/Final Thoughts .

            "content": ". My answer was close because it contained a stribng varible and Boolean variable, which are in the correct answer. My answer was wrong because the names of the variables were not meaningful. C is the correct answer because it uses a string variable and a Boolean variable, the Boolean variable is important because it tells us if the statement is true or false (absent or not.) The named also used for the variable works well because they are appropriate and easy to read. . . I chose C because I narrowed it down to two answers (C and D) and I went with C. I knew it was one of those because the 7th line tells us a = 21, the 6th lines tells us b = 40, and the thrid line tells us c = 30. I said d = 40 because I could not figure out where else it was said, so I went with line 4. I now understand my mistake because I added c and d (30+40) and then divided by 2 so I got 35, which made me confused. I realized I had to do d divided by 2 and then add c (40/2=20+30) to get an answer of 50. . . The first part of the answer I selected was wrong, but the second part of it was correct. If I were to have ran the code I would have got &quot;onno&quot;, which is not noon. C is the correct answer because it uses the word &quot;on&quot;. The second line is basically reversing the word, so you would get &quot;no&quot; and then add the original word back (&quot;on&quot;) to the end, which would give you the word &quot;noon&quot;. .",

Backend Interface for Web API (Control) . An application programming interface (API) is the medium by which different systems of software interact. In our applications we have two big systems:1. Python Backend that stores data beyond a single Web page2. GH Pages/Fastpages Frontend that is responsible for presenting data . To communicate data between Frontend and Backend, this section Backend code provides and interface to the Frontend using a Web Service Endpoint. Examples of endpoints are listed below and can be typed within a browser, which will return JSON data: . https://flask.nighthawkcodingsociety.com/api/jokes | https://flask.nighthawkcodingsociety.com/api/jokes/2 | https://flask.nighthawkcodingsociety.com/api/jokes/random | . As you can see, these Endpoints return JSON. They are NOT that readable by normal humans. However, they are very effective in passing requested data across the Internet. The Frontend code is responsible for formatting and presenting and interface that allows the typical computer user to interact with this data. . The next cell of code is Creating Endpoints that return JSON. This allows developers in the Frontend to interact with Backend data. API is a contract between the Frontend and Backend on how to share data. . FYI, there is NO output from this section . . from flask import Blueprint, jsonify # jsonify creates an endpoint response object from flask_restful import Api, Resource # used for REST API building import requests # used for testing import random # Blueprints allow this code to be procedurally abstracted from main.py, meaning code is not all in one place app_api = Blueprint(&#39;api&#39;, __name__, url_prefix=&#39;/api/jokes&#39;) # endpoint prefix avoid redundantly typing /api/jokes over and over # API generator https://flask-restful.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#id1 api = Api(app_api) class JokesAPI: # not implemented, this would be where we would allow creation of a new Joke class _Create(Resource): def post(self, joke): pass # getJokes() class _Read(Resource): def get(self): return jsonify(getJokes()) # getJoke(id) class _ReadID(Resource): def get(self, id): return jsonify(getJoke(id)) # getRandomJoke() class _ReadRandom(Resource): def get(self): return jsonify(getRandomJoke()) # getRandomJoke() class _ReadCount(Resource): def get(self): count = countJokes() countMsg = {&#39;count&#39;: count} return jsonify(countMsg) # put method: addJokeHaHa class _UpdateLike(Resource): def put(self, id): addJokeHaHa(id) return jsonify(getJoke(id)) # put method: addJokeBooHoo class _UpdateJeer(Resource): def put(self, id): addJokeBooHoo(id) return jsonify(getJoke(id)) # building RESTapi interfaces, these routes are added to Web Server http://&lt;server&lt;/api/jokes api.add_resource(_Create, &#39;/create/&lt;string:joke&gt;&#39;) api.add_resource(_Read, &#39;/&#39;) # default, which returns all jokes api.add_resource(_ReadID, &#39;/&lt;int:id&gt;&#39;) api.add_resource(_ReadRandom, &#39;/random&#39;) api.add_resource(_ReadCount, &#39;/count&#39;) api.add_resource(_UpdateLike, &#39;/like/&lt;int:id&gt;/&#39;) api.add_resource(_UpdateJeer, &#39;/jeer/&lt;int:id&gt;/&#39;) .

As more and more developers use APIs, they build standards in how you setup a client, send requests and receive information... . Covid19 RapidAPI Example . To begin the API journey. You need to find an API provider. . RapidAPI is a great option. You must setup and account, but there are many free options. | Goto this page for starters, the Corona virus World and India data- Under Code Snippets pick Python - Requests | . RapidAPI, you will select Python Requests type of code to work with you Notebook. . The url is the endpoint to which the API is directed | The headers is a dictionary data structure to send special messaging to the endpoint | The requests.request() python function is used to send a request and retrieve their responses | The response variable receives result of of the request in JSON text | . Next step, is to format the response according to your data science needs . &quot;&quot;&quot; Requests is a HTTP library for the Python programming language.

James . console.log output showing use of a function . This example passes the previously defined variable &quot;msg&quot; to the newly defined &quot;function logIt(output)&quot;. . There are two steps in the code, the definition of the function and the call to the function. &quot;function logIt(output) {}&quot; and everything between curly braces is the definitions of the function. | &quot;logIt(msg)&quot; is the call to the function, this actually activates the function.

Showing reuse of a function . Now that a function is defined, it can be called from any of the subsequent cell in the Jupyter notebook.

Reuse of logIT Hello, Students! 2022 . Dynamic or Loosely typed language (string, number) . JavaScript is a loosely typed language, meaning you don&#39;t have to specify what type of information will be stored in a variable in advance. The variable type is determined at runtime. This is similar to Python and most interpretive languages. Java which is a compiled language is strongly typed, thus you will see string, integer, double, and object in the source code. In JavaScript, the &quot;typeof&quot; keyword returns the type. . function logItType(output) { console.log(typeof output, &quot;;&quot;, output); } console.log(&quot;Looking at dynamic nature of types in JavaScript&quot;) logItType(&quot;hello&quot;); // String logItType(2020); // Number logItType([1, 2, 3]); // Object is generic for this Array, which similar to Python List . Looking at dynamic nature of types in JavaScript string ; hello number ; 2020 object ; [ 1, 2, 3 ] . Build a Person Function/Class object and JSON . JavaScript functions have special properties and syntax is shown in many ways. In fact, a Class in JavaScript is a special function. Jupyter Notebooks seems to be more friendly to &quot;function&quot; definitions versus &quot;Class&quot;, thus this lesson uses &quot;function&quot; and &quot;prototype&quot; versus &quot;Class&quot;. . Definition of function allows for a collection of data, the &quot;function Person&quot; allows programmer to retain name, github id, and class of designation. | Definition of a prototype allow for the definition of a method associated with the function , the &quot;Person.prototype.toJSON&quot; allows the collection of data to be expressed in a json/string versus JavaScript object. | Instance of a function, the &quot;var teacher = new Person(&quot;Mr M&quot;, &quot;jm1021&quot;, 1977)&quot; line makes a variable &quot;teacher&quot; which is an object representation of &quot;function Person&quot;. | . // define a function to hold data for a Person function Person(name, ghID, classOf, sport) { this.name = name; this.ghID = ghID; this.classOf = classOf; this.sport = sport; this.role = &quot;&quot;; } // define a setter for role in Person data Person.prototype.setRole = function(role) { this.role = role; } // define a JSON conversion &quot;method&quot; associated with Person Person.prototype.toJSON = function() { const obj = {name: this.name, ghID: this.ghID, classOf: this.classOf, role: this.role, sport: this.sport,}; const json = JSON.stringify(obj); return json; } // make a new Person and assign to variable teacher var teacher = new Person(&quot;Mr M&quot;, &quot;jm1021&quot;, 1977, &quot;coding&quot;); teacher.setRole(&quot;Teacher&quot;); // output of Object and JSON/string associated with Teacher logItType(teacher); // object type is easy to work with in JavaScript logItType(teacher.toJSON()); // json/string is useful when passing data on internet . object ; Person { name: &#39;Mr M&#39;, ghID: &#39;jm1021&#39;, classOf: 1977, sport: &#39;coding&#39;, role: &#39;Teacher&#39; } string ; {&#34;name&#34;:&#34;Mr M&#34;,&#34;ghID&#34;:&#34;jm1021&#34;,&#34;classOf&#34;:1977,&#34;role&#34;:&#34;Teacher&#34;,&#34;sport&#34;:&#34;coding&#34;} .

The point of the assignment was to get comfortable with code.org but specifically java script. . # Managing Complexity . An example of complexity management in this quiz is the layout. The quiz is divided into two parts: pasword and exploration in the program. This can easily be seen in the first part of the code, each command has its own defined function. . Challenges . Since I created a Jeopardy game there were lots of buttons that I had to create so I had to make sure the names were correct, so I could easily find them, I also had a little trouble while making a question with text entry. .",

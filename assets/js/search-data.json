            "content": "Hacks . Record your findings when testing the time elapsed of the different algorithms. | Although we will go more in depth later, time complexity is a key concept that relates to the different sorting algorithms. | Do some basic research on the different types of sorting algorithms and their time complexity. | Insertion Sort: An algorithm that builds the final sorted array one item at a time. It inserts each element into its proper position in the final sorted array. The time complexity of Insertion Sort is also O(n^2). | . | Selection Sort: An algorithm that sorts an array by repeatedly finding the minimum element from unsorted part and putting it at the beginning. The time complexity of Selection Sort is also O(n^2). | . | Why is time and space complexity important when choosing an algorithm? . | The time complexity of an algorithm refers to the amount of time it takes to execute the algorithm as a function of the input size. In other words, it measures how quickly the algorithm runs as the input size grows larger. An algorithm with a lower time complexity will execute faster than an algorithm with a higher time complexity. When dealing with large input sizes, even small differences in time complexity can have a significant impact on the overall performance of the algorithm. | . | The space complexity of an algorithm refers to the amount of memory space required by the algorithm as a function of the input size. In other words, it measures how much memory the algorithm needs to store and manipulate the input data. An algorithm with a lower space complexity will use less memory than an algorithm with a higher space complexity. When working with limited memory resources, it is important to choose an algorithm with a lower space complexity to avoid memory overflow errors and other performance issues. | . | Should you always use a constant time algorithm / Should you never use an exponential time algorithm? Explain? . | No, you should not always use a constant time algorithm nor should you never use an exponential time algorithm. | . | The choice of algorithm depends on the problem at hand and the size of the input data. Constant time algorithms are generally preferred as they have a time complexity that does not depend on the size of the input data, and thus, they execute in a constant amount of time regardless of the input size. This means that constant time algorithms can be very efficient for small or fixed-sized input data. However, it is not always possible to design a constant time algorithm for every problem, and sometimes constant time algorithms may not be the most efficient option for larger input sizes. | . | On the other hand, exponential time algorithms are generally avoided as they have a time complexity that grows exponentially with the size of the input data. This means that they can quickly become impractical and inefficient for larger input sizes. However, exponential time algorithms may be the only option for some problems, and sometimes they may be the most efficient option for smaller input sizes. | . | What are some general patterns that you noticed to determine each algorithm&#39;s time and space complexity? . | Constant Time Complexity (O(1)): The time complexity is constant if the number of operations performed by the algorithm remains the same, regardless of the input size. Examples of algorithms with constant time complexity include accessing an element in an array or performing arithmetic operations. | . | Linear Time Complexity (O(n)): The time complexity is linear if the number of operations performed by the algorithm increases linearly with the input size. Examples of algorithms with linear time complexity include iterating over an array or linked list, or searching for an element in an unsorted array. | . | Quadratic Time Complexity (O(n^2)): The time complexity is quadratic if the number of operations performed by the algorithm increases quadratically with the input size. Examples of algorithms with quadratic time complexity include nested loops that iterate over an array or matrix. | . | Logarithmic Space Complexity (O(log n)): The space complexity is logarithmic if the amount of memory used by the algorithm increases logarithmically with the input size. Examples of algorithms with logarithmic space complexity include recursive algorithms that divide the input data into smaller subproblems. | . | . Complete the Time and Space Complexity analysis questions linked below. Practice .",

Understand the concept of data structures, including lists, dictionaries, and 2D arrays | Learn how to iterate through data structures using loops | Able to visualize data structures and iteration processes | Able to apply their knowledge to build simulations/interactions using lists and iteration | Learn how to store list and dictionary content in databases | . Lesson 1: Lists and Iteration . Lists (Ethan) . Lists are a type of data structure that can store multiple items in a single variable | Lists are defined using square brackets [ ] | Each item in a list is separated by a comma | Lists are indexed, starting at 0 | . fruits = [&quot;apple&quot;, &quot;banana&quot;, &quot;orange&quot;, &quot;grape&quot;] print(fruits) . [&#39;apple&#39;, &#39;banana&#39;, &#39;orange&#39;, &#39;grape&#39;] . Accessing Lists . To access individual items in a list, we use the index of the item. | Python uses zero-based indexing, which means the first item in the list has an index of 0, the second item has an index of 1, and so on. | . print(fruits[0]) print(fruits[2]) . apple orange . Slicing Lists . We can also extract a specific portion of a list using slicing. | We use the colon : operator to specify a range of indices to include. | . print(fruits[0:2]) . [&#39;apple&#39;, &#39;banana&#39;] . Modifying List Items . Lists are mutable, meaning that we can change the value of an item in a list. | To change the value of an item in a list, we can use the indexing operator (square brackets) to access the item and then assign a new value to it. | . fruits[2] = &quot;pear&quot; print(fruits) . [&#39;apple&#39;, &#39;banana&#39;, &#39;pear&#39;, &#39;grape&#39;, &#39;kiwi&#39;] . Adding and Removing List Items . Adding .

Use the clear() method to remove all items from a list. | . fruits.clear() # Removes all items from the list print(fruits) . [] . Function Explanation . InsertToList . This function is designed to insert a new item into a list at a specific index. | It first retrieves the new item to be added and the index at which to add it from the HTML document. | It checks if the retrieved values are both valid integers and if the index is within the range of the list. | If the values are valid, the function uses the splice() method to insert the new item into the list at the specified index. | In JavaScript, the splice() method modifies an array by removing, replacing, or adding elements. | The splice() method takes three arguments:the index at which to start changing the list, the number of elements to remove, and the new item to add. - The item is inserted without removing any elements, so we pass 0 as the second argument. | Finally, the function calls the visualizeList() function to display the updated list on the web page. | . // Get the value of the new item and the index where it should be inserted function insertToList() { let newItem = parseInt(document.getElementById(&quot;newItem&quot;).value); let index = parseInt(document.getElementById(&quot;index&quot;).value); if (!isNaN(newItem) &amp;&amp; !isNaN(index) &amp;&amp; index &gt;= 0 &amp;&amp; index &lt;= myList.length) { // splice() method to insert the new item into the list myList.splice(index - 1, 0, newItem); // Call the visualizeList() function to update the display of the list visualizeList(); } } . SortList . In JavaScript, sort() is a built-in method used to sort the elements of an array in place. The default sort order is ascending, but you can also specify a descending sort order. | In this case, the function sorts myList in ascending order based on their numerical value. | . // Sort myList array in ascending order function sortList() { // The function a - b is used, which subtracts the second element b from the first element a. // If the result is negative, a is sorted before b. If the result is positive, b is sorted before a. If the result is zero, the order of the elements is unchanged. myList.sort((a, b) =&gt; a - b); visualizeList(); } . Applications of Lists . Data processing: Lists are commonly used to store and process large amounts of data. In data analysis and machine learning, lists are often used to store datasets. . | Gaming: Lists are used extensively in game development to store game objects, player statistics, and game maps. . | Finance: Lists are used in finance to store and process financial data, such as stock prices and market trends. The data from these lists can also be used to calculate financial metrics and to create financial models. . | . Hacks (0.3) . Make your own list and manipulate it via accessing specific elements, adding or removing elements, etc. | Extra: Make an interactable visualization that can manipulate elements in a list such as the one demonstrated in our flask repository | . nba = [&quot;bulls&quot;, &quot;bucks&quot;, &quot;knicks&quot;, &quot;lakers&quot;, &quot;suns&quot;] print(nba) nba.pop(2) print(nba) .

In programming, iteration refers to the process of repeating a set of instructions until a specific condition is met. This can be achieved using loop structures like for loops and while loops. | . For Loops . A for loop is used to iterate over a sequence (e.g. a list, tuple, string, etc.) and execute a set of statements for each item in the sequence. Here&#39;s the basic syntax of a for loop in Python: | . sequence = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7] for variable in sequence: print(variable) . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 . my_string = &quot;Hello, World!&quot; for character in my_string: print(character) . H e l l o , W o r l d ! . While Loops A while loop is used to repeat a set of statements as long as a condition is true. Here&#39;s the basic syntax of a while loop in Python: . num = 0 while num &lt; 5: print(num) num += 1 . 0 1 2 3 4 . Applications of Iteration . Iteration is a fundamental concept in computer programming and is used in a variety of real-life applications. Here are some examples:Data Processing . Data processing often involves iterating over large datasets to perform specific operations on each element. For example, in a data analysis task, you might iterate over a list of numbers to compute the average, or iterate over a list of strings to find the longest string. | . User Interfaces . User interfaces often involve iteration to display and handle data from various sources. For example, in a web application, you might iterate over a list of users to display their information in a table. Similarly, in a desktop application, you might iterate over a list of files to display them in a file explorer. | . Machine Learning . Machine learning algorithms often involve iterative processes to train models and improve their accuracy. For example, in a gradient descent algorithm, you might iterate over a set of training data to update the model&#39;s parameters and minimize the loss function. | . Popcorn hack (0.3) . Make a list related to your CPT project | Make a while loop that will print each term in the list | Make a for loop that will print each term in the list | . Simulation mechanics . In Python, pop() is a method that is used to remove and return an element from a list. The syntax for using pop() is as follows: | . CPT_List = [&quot;Canes&quot;, &quot;Daves&quot;, &quot;Hike&quot;, &quot;Park&quot;] for variable in CPT_List: print(variable) . Canes Daves Hike Park . num = 0 while num &lt; 3: print(CPT_List[num]) num += 1 . Canes Daves Hike . my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] print(my_list) my_list.pop() print(my_list) my_list.pop(1) print(my_list) . [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] [1, 2, 3, 4] [1, 3, 4] . In Python, append() is a built-in method that is used to add an element to the end of a list. The syntax for using append() is as follows: . my_list = [] my_list.append(1) my_list.append(2) my_list.append(3) print(my_list) . [1, 2, 3] . Dictionary Lesson / 2D Arrays .

What is the purpose of DNS? | The purpose of DNS is turn domain names into IP addresses. | . How does DNS work? | When a user types a domain name into their web browser, the browser sends a request to a DNS resolver, which is a server that is configured to look up the IP address associated with that domain name. | . What is a DNS resolver? | A DNS resolver is a server that is responsible for finding domain names to IP addresses. When a user types a domain name into their browser, the browser sends a request to a DNS resolver, which then looks up the IP address associated with that domain name. | . Make a canva image on the process of DNS (you can base it off of the previous slide) | | . CORS Hacks . Explain what CORS is and what it stands for | CORS stands for Cross-Origin Resource Sharing. It is a mechanism that allows web servers to specify which domains are allowed to access the resources on the server. By default, web browsers restrict cross-origin HTTP requests initiated from scripts, so CORS is used to lessen these restrictions and allow web applications to access resources from different domains. | . Describe how you would be able to implement CORS into your own websites | To implement CORS in a website, the server-side application needs to set the Access-Control-Allow-Origin header to indicate which origins are allowed to access the server&#39;s resources. Then the server can set other headers to control the types of HTTP methods and headers that are allowed to be used in cross-origin requests. | . Describe why you would want to implement CORS into your own websites | To allow access to resources hosted on a different domain, such as third-party API. | . How could use CORS to benefit yourself in the future? | It can demonstrate my skills in web security, which are highly valued skills in the industry. | . Total: 0.2 points . KASM Hacks . What is the purpose of &quot;sudo&quot; when running commands in terminal? | The &quot;sudo&quot; command is used to run commands with extra privileges in a terminal. It allows a user to execute commands as the root user, which has unrestricted access to the system and can perform administrative tasks that regular users cannot. Using &quot;sudo&quot; is necessary when performing tasks that require administrative privileges, such as installing software. | . What are some commands which allow us to look at how the storage of a machine is set up as? | &quot;df&quot; - displays the amount of disk space used and available on mounted file systems. | . What do you think are some alternatives to running &quot;curl -O&quot; to get the zip file for KASM? | Downloading the zip file manually from the website and saving it to a local directory. | . What kind of commands do you think the &quot;install.sh&quot; command has and why is it necessary to call it? | The &quot;install.sh&quot; command is likely to have commands that install the software that it is associated with. It is necessary to call &quot;install.sh&quot; because it helps the installation process and ensures that all necessary dependencies are installed correctly. | . Explain in at least 3-4 sentences how deploying KASM is related to/requires other topics talked about in the lesson and/or potential ways to add things mentioned in the lesson to this guide. | Setting up microservices to manage and secure application services across many environments is part of the KASM deployment process. Understanding HTTP is necessary for this because it is the protocol used for microservice communication. In order for the process to function, CORS must be set up to allow cross-domain requests between microservices. Total: 0.2 points | . AWS/RDS Hacks () . See the setup post .

What are some examples of 2d Arrays | Sudoku, Chessboard, Spreadsheet, Tic Tac Toe, and a Calendar | What is a modern day game that could be classified as a 2D array | Minesweeper | Describe a 2D array in your own words | A 2D array is a collection of data elements organized in a grid format consisting of rows and columns. It is a data structure that can be used to store and manipulate data. | What is the defenition of iteration in your own words | Iteration is a process that involves repeating a set of instructions or code multiple times until a specific condition is met or a desired result is achieved. | What parts of the code use iteration | The following parts of the code use iteration: | The &quot;for&quot; loops used to push &#39;up&#39;, &#39;down&#39;, &#39;left&#39;, and &#39;right&#39; movements to the &#39;movements&#39; array use iteration to repeat the code block multiple times. | The &quot;setInterval&quot; function is also an example of iteration, as it executes the provided function repeatedly at a specified interval until the condition of the &quot;if&quot; statement is met. | Explain which parts of the code use lists | The following parts of the code use lists: | The variable &quot;word_list&quot; is a list of words that can be randomly selected for the game. | The line &quot;word = random.choice(word_list)&quot; selects a random word from the &quot;word_list&quot; and assigns it to the variable &quot;word&quot;. | The line &quot;scrambled_word = &quot;&quot;.join(random.sample(word, len(word)))&quot; uses the &quot;random.sample&quot; function to shuffle the letters of the selected word, and then joins them back together into a string. | Explain what list manipulation is happening in that part | The list manipulation happens when creating the scrambled_word variable. It takes a word from the word_list and shuffles its letters using random.sample() to create a new, scrambled version of the word. The join() function then concatenates the shuffled letters back together into a string. This process manipulates the order of the letters in the word to create a new list, which is then turned into a string. | .

It is a list of three lists, where each list contains three elements representing a row of the board. Each element can have the value &#39;X&#39;, &#39;O&#39;, or &#39; &#39; (an empty space). | Minesweeper, Battleship, and Connect Four | . List and Dictionaries . A list is an ordered collection of elements that can be of any data type. Elements in a list are stored in a linear sequence and are indexed by their position in the list. Lists can be modified after creation. You can add, remove, or modify elements in a list. You can also access individual elements of a list using indexing operations. | A dictionar is an unordered collection of key-value pairs. Each element in a dictionary is identified by a unique key, which is used to retrieve the corresponding value. Dictionariescan be modified by adding, removing, or updating key-value pairs. Unlike lists, dictionaries are not indexed by position; instead, they are indexed by their keys. | . numbers = [2, 4, 5, 1, 3] numbers.sort() print(numbers) numbers.pop(0) print(numbers) .

It is similar to a column in a spreadsheet or a SQL table. Each element in a Series has a label, known as an index. A Series can be created from a list, a NumPy array, a dictionary, or another Pandas Series. | DataFrame ;A DataFrame is a two-dimensional labeled data structure that can hold data of different types (integer, float, string, etc.). It is similar to a spreadsheet or a SQL table. Each column in a DataFrame is a Series, and each row is indexed by a label, known as an index. A DataFrame can be created from a dictionary of Series or NumPy arrays, a list of dictionaries, or other Pandas DataFrame. | . Dataframes . import pandas as pd . pd.__version__ . Importing CSV Data . imports the Pandas library and assigns it an alias &#39;pd&#39;. | Loads a CSV file named &#39;nba_player_statistics.csv&#39; into a Pandas DataFrame called &#39;df&#39;. | Specifies a player&#39;s name &#39;Jimmy Butler&#39; to filter the DataFrame for that player&#39;s stats. It creates a new DataFrame called &#39;player_stats&#39; which only contains rows where the &#39;NAME&#39; column matches &#39;Jimmy Butler&#39;. | Displays the player&#39;s stats for points per game (PPG), rebounds per game (RPG), and assists per game (APG) using the print() function and string formatting. | The code uses the double square brackets [[PPG&#39;, &#39;RPG&#39;, &#39;APG&#39;]] to select only the columns corresponding to the player&#39;s points per game, rebounds per game, and assists per game from the player_stats DataFrame. | In summary, the code loads NBA player statistics data from a CSV file, filters it for a specific player, and displays the stats for that player&#39;s PPG, RPG, and APG using a Pandas DataFrame. | . import pandas as pd # Load the CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame df = pd.read_csv(&#39;/Users/josh/Repository-1/nba_player_statistics.csv&#39;) # Filter the DataFrame to only include stats for a specific player (in this case, Jimmy Butler) player_name = &#39;Jimmy Butler&#39; player_stats = df[df[&#39;NAME&#39;] == player_name] # Display the stats for the player print(f&quot; nStats for {player_name}:&quot;) print(player_stats[[&#39;PPG&#39;, &#39;RPG&#39;, &#39;APG&#39;]]) . In this code segment below we use Pandas to read a CSV file containing NBA player statistics and store it in a DataFrame. . The reason Pandas is useful in this scenario is because it provides various functionalities to filter, sort, and manipulate the NBA data efficiently. In this code, the DataFrame is filtered to only include the stats for the player you guys choose. . Imports the Pandas library and assigns it an alias &#39;pd&#39;. | Loads a CSV file named &#39;nba_player_statistics.csv&#39; into a Pandas DataFrame called &#39;df&#39;. | Asks the user to input a player name using the input() function and assigns it to the variable player_name. | Filters the DataFrame for the specified player name using the df[df[&#39;NAME&#39;] == player_name] syntax, and assigns the resulting DataFrame to the variable player_stats. | Checks if the player_stats DataFrame is empty using the empty attribute.

If the player is not found in the DataFrame, it prints a message indicating that no stats were found. | . import pandas as pd df = pd.read_csv(&#39;/Users/josh/Repository-1/nba_player_statistics.csv&#39;) # Load CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame player_name = input(&quot;Enter player name: &quot;) # Get player name input from user player_stats = df[df[&#39;NAME&#39;] == player_name] # Filter the DataFrame to only include stats for the specified player if player_stats.empty: print(&quot;No stats found for that player.&quot;) else: # Check if the player exists in the DataFrame print(f&quot; nStats for {player_name}:&quot;) print(player_stats[[&#39;PPG&#39;, &#39;RPG&#39;, &#39;APG&#39;, &#39;P+R+A&#39;]]) # Display the stats for the player inputted. . Lesson Portion 4 . What we will be covering . Example of analyzing data using both NumPy and Pandas libraries | Importing data into NumPy and Pandas Performing basic data analysis tasks such as mean, median, and standard deviation Visualization of data using Matplotlib library | . Example of analyzing data using both NumPy and Pandas libraries . import numpy as np import pandas as pd # Load CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame df = pd.read_csv(&#39;/Users/josh/Repository-1/nba_player_statistics.csv&#39;) # Filter the DataFrame to only include stats for the specified player player_name = input(&quot;Enter player name: &quot;) player_stats = df[df[&#39;NAME&#39;] == player_name] if player_stats.empty: print(&quot;No stats found for that player.&quot;) else: # Convert the player stats to a NumPy array player_stats_np = np.array(player_stats[[&#39;PPG&#39;, &#39;RPG&#39;, &#39;APG&#39;, &#39;P+R+A&#39;]]) # Calculate the average of each statistic for the player player_stats_avg = np.mean(player_stats_np, axis=0) # Print out the average statistics for the player print(f&quot; nAverage stats for {player_name}:&quot;) print(f&quot;PPG: {player_stats_avg[0]:.2f}&quot;) print(f&quot;RPG: {player_stats_avg[1]:.2f}&quot;) print(f&quot;APG: {player_stats_avg[2]:.2f}&quot;) print(f&quot;P+R+A: {player_stats_avg[3]:.2f}&quot;) . NumPy impacts the given code because it performs operations on arrays efficiently. Specifically, it converts a Pandas DataFrame object to a NumPy array object, and then calculates the average statistics for a the player you guys inputted. Without NumPy, it would be more difficult and less efficient to perform these calculations on large data sets. It does the math for us. . Importing data into NumPy and Pandas Performing basic data analysis tasks such as mean, median, and standard deviation Visualization of data using Matplotlib library . Matplotlib is used essentially to create visuals of data. charts,diagrams,etc. . import numpy as np import pandas as pd import matplotlib.pyplot as plt # Load the CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame df = pd.read_csv(&#39;/Users/josh/Repository-1/nba_player_statistics.csv&#39;) # Print the first 5 rows of the DataFrame print(df.head()) # Calculate the mean, median, and standard deviation of the &#39;Points&#39; column mean_minutes = df[&#39;MPG&#39;].mean() median_minutes = df[&#39;MPG&#39;].median() stddev_minutes = df[&#39;MPG&#39;].std() # Print the results print(&#39;Mean Minutes: &#39;, mean_minutes) print(&#39;Median Minutes: &#39;, median_minutes) print(&#39;Standard Deviation Minutes: &#39;, stddev_minutes) # Create a histogram of the &#39;Points&#39; column using Matplotlib plt.hist(df[&#39;MPG&#39;], bins=20) plt.title(&#39;MPG Histogram&#39;) plt.xlabel(&#39;MPG&#39;) plt.ylabel(&#39;Frequency&#39;) plt.show() . In this example code, we first import the necessary libraries, including NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib. We then load the CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame using the pd.read_csv() function. We print the first 5 rows of the DataFrame using the df.head() function. Next, we calculate the mean, median, and standard deviation of the &#39;MPG&#39; column using the appropriate Pandas methods, and print the results. And, we create a histogram of the &#39;MPG&#39; column using Matplotlib by calling the plt.hist() function and setting appropriate axis labels and a title. We then call the plt.show() method to display the plot. Even though NumPy is not directly used in this code, it is an important underlying component of the pandas and Matplotlib libraries, which are used to load, manipulate and visualize data. It allows them to work more efficiently . Lesson Portion 5; Summary . Summary/Goals of Lesson: . One of our goals was to make you understand data analysis and how it can be important in optimizing business performance. We also wanted to make sure you understood the use of Pandas and NumPy libraries in data analysis, with a focus on NumPy. As someone who works with data, we find Pandas incredibly useful for manipulating, analyzing, and visualizing data in Python. The way we use pandas is to calculate individual player and team statistics. We are a group that works with numerical data, so NumPy is one of our favorite tools for working with arrays and applying mathematical functions to them. It is very fast at computing and manipulating arrays making it a very valuable tool for tracking statistics which is important to our group. For example, if you have an array of the points scored by each player in a game, you can use NumPy to calculate the total points scored, average points per player, or the highest and lowest scoring players. .

            "content": "What is a Hashtable/Hashmap? . A hashtable is a data structure that with a collection of key-value pairs, where each key maps to a value, and the keys must be unique and hashable. . In Python there is a built in hashtable known as a dictionary. | . The primary purpose of a hashtable is to provide efficient lookup, insertion, and deletion operations. When an element is to be inserted into the hashtable, a hash function is used to map the key to a specific index in the underlying array that is used to store the key-value pairs. The value is then stored at that index. When searching for a value, the hash function is used again to find the index where the value is stored. . The key advantage of a hashtable over other data structures like arrays and linked lists is its average-case time complexity for lookup, insertion, and deletion operations. . The typical time complexity of a hashtable is O(1). | . What is Hashing and Collision? . Hashing is the process of mapping a given key to a value in a hash table or hashmap, using a hash function. The hash function takes the key as input and produces a hash value or hash code, which is then used to determine the index in the underlying array where the value is stored. The purpose of hashing is to provide a quick and efficient way to access data, by eliminating the need to search through an entire data structure to find a value. . However, it is possible for two different keys to map to the same hash value, resulting in a collision. When a collision occurs, there are different ways to resolve it, depending on the collision resolution strategy used. . Python&#39;s dictionary implementation is optimized to handle collisions efficiently, and the performance of the dictionary is generally very good, even in the presence of collisions. However, if the number of collisions is very high, the performance of the dictionary can degrade, so it is important to choose a good hash function that minimizes collisions when designing a Python dictionary. .

My answer is incorrect because the total dollar amount of food and drinks sold during a show may be correlated with the attendance at the show, but cannot be used to determine the exact number of attendees. . . My answer is incorrect because the information can be determined using the data collected, but not the way described in this option. One way to determine the method of payment that was used in the greatest number of transactions during the 7-day period is to sort the data by the method of payment as described. Instead of adding the number of items purchased for each type of payment, a count of each payment type needs to be computed. If the counts are stored in a new field, then the counts can be sorted to find the method of payment used in the greatest number of transactions. .",

What is the function of the identity column in a SQL database? | The purpose of the ID column is to distinguish each user from one another based on their unique ID. | . | What is the purpose of a primary key in a SQL database? | Similar to the identity column, the primary key distinguishes each user, enabling code to interact with the intended object. | . | What are some of the data types that can be found in an SQL table? | SQL tables may include data types such as floats, integers, strings, dates, and more. | . | . import sqlite3 database = &#39;instance/sqlite.db&#39; # this is location of database def schema(): # Connect to the database file conn = sqlite3.connect(database) # Create a cursor object to execute SQL queries cursor = conn.cursor() # Fetch results of Schema results = cursor.execute(&quot;PRAGMA table_info(&#39;users&#39;)&quot;).fetchall() # Print the results for row in results: print(row) # Close the database connection conn.close() schema() . Reading Users table in Sqlite.db . Uses SQL SELECT statement to read data . What is a connection object? After you google it, what do you think it does? | Same for cursor object? | Look at conn object and cursor object in VSCode debugger. What attributes are in the object? | Is &quot;results&quot; an object? How do you know? ** . | A connection object is an instance of a class that represents a connection to a database. From my research, it appears that a connection object is used to manage the connection between a Python program and a database server. It provides a way to send queries to the database and to receive results back. . | A cursor object is another instance of a class that is used to traverse through the results of a query. It is used to execute SQL statements and retrieve data from a database. It provides a way to navigate through the results and access individual rows of data. The attributes in the connection and cursor objects depend on the specific database API and the implementation of the class. In general, a connection object may have attributes such as the server address, port number, username, and password. A cursor object may have attributes such as the query string and the results of the query. To see the attributes of a specific object, you would need to inspect it in the debugger or use the object&#39;s methods to retrieve the attribute values. | &quot;Results&quot; may or may not be an object, depending on the context in which it is being used. In general, &quot;results&quot; is a generic term that can refer to any data returned from a query, such as a set of rows or a single value. If &quot;results&quot; is being used as a variable name in a program, it could potentially refer to an object that holds the data returned from a query. However, without additional context or information, it is impossible to determine whether &quot;results&quot; is an object or not. | . import sqlite3 def read(): # Connect to the database file conn = sqlite3.connect(database) # Create a cursor object to execute SQL queries cursor = conn.cursor() # Execute a SELECT statement to retrieve data from a table results = cursor.execute(&#39;SELECT * FROM users&#39;).fetchall() # Print the results if len(results) == 0: print(&quot;Table is empty&quot;) else: for row in results: print(row) # Close the cursor and connection objects cursor.close() conn.close() read() .

My answer is wrong because it uses one crucial word (not) in that last sentence which makes it incorrect. With the answer I selected the algorithm will turn on the motor in some cases when the gate sensor is not activated. D is correct because after the first check if the time is during business hours, the algorithm continues past the second check if the gate sensor is activated, and then it continues past the third check if the gate is not open. Performing the checks in this order will make sure the gate is open only when it should be. . My answer is wrong because it says to turn left after moving 2 blocks foward when it should really say to move right. Answer D is correct because the robot first moves forward three spaces, then turns to the left, then after it moves forward two spaces, turns to the right, and moves forward three spaces and arrives at the gray square. . My answer is wrong because when scoreC &gt; scoreB &gt; scoreA, the code segment incorrectly identifies Team B as the winner instead of Team C. My answer defines the wrong winner. A is the correct answer because If scoreA is greater than both scoreB and scoreC (the first two IF statements), then Team A wins. If scoreA is greater than scoreB but not greater than scoreC, then scoreC is greater than both scoreA and scoreB and Team C wins. If scoreB is greater than scoreA (the outer ELSE statement) and scoreC (the IF statment in the outer ELSE), then Team B wins. If scoreB is greater than scoreA but not greater than scoreC, then scoreC is greater than both scoreA and scoreB and Team C wins. . My answer is wrong because I thought the order was flipped, so the 1st line was going to be displayed 2nd, but it was displayed 1st and vice versa with the second line, no idea why I thought this. I new it started with a number, because it prints (num) first and then the 2 strings.

When the time came, Caleb had to take care of something, so he was not ready, but we still continued on. We presented to mostly parents and a few other students. Some of the parents and students just listened, while some of them asked questions like, &quot;how are you generating these locations?&quot; and, &quot;what is it deployed through?&quot;. We tried waiting for Caleb, but it was getting too close to the end, so we just decided to present and Mr.Yeung and everything went well and I think he liked it.

For our porject we are a house renting service in San Diego, so location is important. | . What are your feelings about PII and your personal exposure? . I feel that PII and my personal exposure is very important because that type of information is very important to me as a person and that information is apart of my identity. This is why I try and make sure I can make my account as secure as possible, with things like 2FA. I also try and look out for potiential viruses or links that could expose my personal data. | . Describe good and bad passwords? What is another step that is used to assist in authentication. . Good passwords are ones that contain at least 8-12 characters, ones that contain special characters, numbers, and upper and lowercase letters. The good passwords are typically complex. A bad password on the other hand is a password that is esay to guess, short, doesn&#39;t contain any special characters, and contains the users name. Another step to assist in authentication is 2FA. 2FA keeps a certian code on file or generates a code and then sends it user. The user must use this code in order to login into their account, so people who do not have access to the email or phone number cannot get in. | .

With Asymmetric encryption there are two keys: one public key and one private key, that are used to to protect a message from unauthorized access or use. | .

I am very cautious when it comes to my personal information, so I stay away from random links that are texted to me and random emails that I recieve. I also use an ad blocker some times to limit the chances of me falling for something.

I think this datt makes sense because Tiktok is directed at a younger audience due to its bright colors and dancing trends, while Facebook is directed towards at a older audience due to it duller colors and it has been around longer. | Why do virtual assistants have female voices? Amazon, Alexa Google, Apple Siri. I think that virtual assistants have female voices because they are trying to represent a mother and mothers usually symbolize comfort. Female voices can also be perceived as friendly and helpful and people potentially could just prefer female voices as they tend to be more comforting. | Talk about an algorithm that influences your decisions, think about these companies (ie FAANG - Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, Google) I think most of these companies specifically Amazon they track what you search and then they provide products that are similar to what you have been looking at. I also do feel other companies do the same thing, it might not be what you search, but really anything you interact with (ex: liking a post and then it will give you similar posts to the one you liked) | Does the owner of the computer think this was intentional? No I do not think the owner of the computer did this intentionally. I think this happened because when they were testing the camera they tried it on little to no people of color. It is harmful because the camera may not work for everyone, but I don&#39;t think they meant to do thim. I think this should be corrected and to do that they should try it on people of color, so then they know it works for everyone. | . Big Idea 5.4 Crowdsourcing . CompSci has 150 ish principles students. Describe a crowdsource idea and how you might initiate it in our environment? . Since we are working on our projects we can create a survey that people can fill out anonymously and provide feedback and suggest changes that could make someones project better. Another idea is we can create a website that everyone can work on and sumbit their own ideas and then collaborate with others to develop the idea. | . What about Del Norte crowdsourcing? Could your project be better with crowdsourcing? . We can use Del Norte students and staff to come up with ideas that could make the school a better place and we could also find things people don&#39;t like about the school and fix those problems. Our project could be better with crowdsourcing because if we ask other people about things they don&#39;t like then we can change them. We can also ask people about what places they like to vacation (we are a hosue renting service,) so then our project can actually be used to help people. | . What kind of data could you capture at N@tM to make evening interesting? Perhaps use this data to impress Teachers during finals week. . At the N@tM I think it would be important to collect how important our project is to each person on a scale of 1-10. With this data we can show how our project can be useful in the real world or how it would not be useful. This also provides us with feedback and the thoughts of others outside of our group. | .",

            "title": "Quiz 2 Results & Corrections",
            "content": "My Score . My Corrections . My answer is wrong because mine is not multplying by 3 the command that says repeat 3 times indicates multiplication and I used addition. This is also in correct because iff the value of y was 2, the inner loop would repeat two times and the outer loop would repeat three times. The statement result &lt; result + 1 would be executed 3 times 2, or six times. When y = 2, the value of y + 3 is 5, not 6. . My answer is wrong because eventually the loop will reach 7 wheras with 6 it won&#39;t because the number is always going to be odd. This is also incorrect because the value of the variable j starts at 1 and increases by 2. If &lt; MISSING CONDITION &gt; is replaced with the expression j = 7, the expression will evaluate to true when j is 7 and the loop will end. . The robot can only be in one of four squares in the grid, given that p is a positive integer. These squares include the starting position, two squares above facing up, two squares above and two to the right facing right, or two to the right facing left. The position depicted is not a possible final location. . I got part of the question correct, but B is not correct because it will not get the robot to the gray square, but C will, so the answers are A and C. A is correct because with each iteration of the Repeat 4 times loop, the robot will move one square to the left and one square up and will remain facing up. After four of these iterations, the robot will finish in the gray square. . A is wrong because it should draw the circle after the radius and y value is adjusted, this is also why B is correct. D has the same error it draws the circle before the y and r values are adjusted, which is why C is correct, so the 2 answers are C and B. . A is incorrect because only at some times value will be 2 and make the procedure true, but everytime the number is going to be even, which is why C is correct. A is also incorrect because if the initial value of number is 4, the REPEAT UNTIL loop will reduce the value of number to 2, and then to 0, at which point the loop will terminate. The procedure will return true, not false. . C is not correct because there is no way for the robot to end above the starting position (it either goes left or right,) which is why B must be correct. It is also incorrect because the robot turns right one, two, or three times and could end up in a square to the left of its initial position. It cannot end up in a square above its initial position. . This question was confusing and I did not really understand what they were asking for, but I put B and C and the answers were A and D. According to college board the answer is not B becuase, The statement Random (1, 5) could evaluate to 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5. There is a two out of five, or 40 percent, chance that it could evaluate to 1 or 2. If this happens, the value of sum is increased by 1, which simulates a person voting for the candidate. This does not match the goal of the program, which is to simulate an election in which a certain candidate is expected to receive 20 percent of the vote. . Answer B is incorrect (interchanging line 5 and line 6) because since they are both inside of FOR EACH loop interchanging them will not affect the number of operations performed. Answer D is correct (interchanging line 7 and line 8) because then you will be able to find the final average instead of having it keep repeating and getting different averages. .",

How does someone empower themself in a digital world? . Having a set of digital skills can be very beneficial. In the digital world if you have digital skills it can lead to you having job advantages and better communication. Understanding how the digital world works can help you identify security risks and help you prevent youself from falling for one. Being involved in the digital world can allow you to stay up to date with digital trends and it can allow you to access new opportunities. | . How does someone that is empowered help someone that is not empowered? Describe something you could do at Del Norte HS. . Someone that is empowered can help someone that is not empowered by becoming almost like a mentor for them by teaching and showing their skills, so that person that is not empowered will be able to become empowered. At Del Norte HS I can teach some of the people about APCSP and show they how the skills I am learning can be very useful in the real world and how them can empower someone. | . Is paper or red tape blocking digital empowerment? Are there such barriers at Del Norte? Elsewhere? . I think paper in some ways is blocking digital empowerment because people that have grown up with paper are going to be more inclined to use paper over technology. There are also some other things that are blocking digital empowerment like the expense of it and the limited access some people have. I dont think there are such barriers at Del Norte because almost every student at one point was working online during covid, so everyone has had some experience with technology. Also for the people that have a hard time accessing technology at Del Norte stduents are able to get their own chromebooks. On the other hand some people may not be as fortunate, so I do see the expense of technology blocking digital empowerment. | .",

            "content": "Submission 1 . Reporting Category Student Score College Board Score Comments &lt;/tr&gt; Program Purpose and Function | 1 | 1 | The video shows a program that allows the user to input their choice of rock, paper, or scissors and the computer will randomly select one as well. The output will show the result of the match and give the user the option to play again. The program&#39;s purpose is to make a decision. | . Data Abstraction | 0 | 0 | Two code segments are shown, one storing data in a list named RPS, and the other does not access the data. The data stored in the list are the options that the computer can select as its input. | . Managing Complexity | 0 | 0 | The response explains that the program can be written without using a list by setting the variable &quot;cpuPlay&quot; using an if statement based on a random number, but it would not affect the complexity or ease of development/maintenance of the program. | . Procedural Abstraction | 0 | 0 | The response includes a student-developed procedure, &quot;rpsGame&quot;, which takes one parameter, &quot;yourPlay&quot; and uses it in a series of if-else statements to output a result based on both user&#39;s and computer&#39;s inputs. The procedure contributes to the overall program by allowing for smooth execution, but it does not specify how. | . Algorithm Implementation | 1 | 1 | The response explains that the student-developed algorithm within procedure, &quot;rpsGame&quot;, includes sequencing, selection (if statement), and iteration through use of recursion. The algorithm randomly selects an item from a list, saves it in a variable &quot;cpuPlay&quot;, displays the computer&#39;s choice, compares it with the user&#39;s input through a series of if-else statements, prints the result, and offers the user to play again. If the user inputs &quot;Yes&quot; the function is called again, if the user inputs &quot;No&quot; the computer prints &quot;Goodbye&quot;. | . Testing | 1 | 1 | The response describes two calls to the procedure with different arguments, leading to different results. The conditions being tested for the two procedure calls are if the user&#39;s input is equal to &quot;Rock&quot; and the computer&#39;s input is &quot;Paper&quot; in the first case and if the user&#39;s input is equal to &quot;Paper&quot; and the computer&#39;s input is &quot;Rock&quot; in the second case. If the conditions are true, the function displays &quot;You Lose!&quot; in the first case and &quot;You Win...&quot; in the second case. | . . Submission 2 . Reporting Category Student Score College Board Score Comments &lt;/tr&gt; Program Purpose and Function | 1 | 1 | The video shows a program that helps users recognize new words and expand their vocabulary. The user inputs letters into a text field, the program outputs the letter in the correct spot of the randomly generated word or reduces the number of lives if the letter is not found, and shows a winning screen if the word is completed. Input includes letters, numbers, symbols and multiple letters in a single guess. | . Data Abstraction | 1 | 1 | Two code segments are provided, the first one stores data in a list named letOfGuessWord, and the second one accesses the data from the list in a for loop. The list holds the individual letters of the word that the user is trying to guess. | . Managing Complexity | 1 | 1 | The response includes a code that uses a list to manage complexity by storing the letters of the word to be guessed. The list is scanned based on its length, which allows for implementation of longer words. The response explains that if the program were to run without the list, it would be inefficient and more complicated as it would require 5 new variables to store individual letters and a for loop to check for a match between the user&#39;s input and the word. | . Procedural Abstraction | 1 | 1 | The response includes a student-developed procedure, &quot;guessWords&quot; which takes a parameter and uses it to compare the user&#39;s input to the letters of the randomly generated word. If the user&#39;s input matches the letter, it will display the letter in the correct spot and if the program does not find the letter in the word, it will take a life away from the user. The procedure contributes to the overall functionality of the program by doing the work of comparing the letters and determining the result. | . Algorithm Implementation | 1 | 1 | The student-developed algorithm within procedure, &quot;guessWords&quot;, includes sequencing, selection (if statement), and iteration (for loop). The algorithm uses a for loop to loop through the entire list by the length of the word that the user is trying to guess, then uses an if statement to compare the letter that the user inputted to all of the letters in the randomly generated word. If the if statement condition is true, it sets the letter that the user inputted to the index of where the letter was found in the randomly generated word, sets a boolean &quot;check&quot; to true, and adds 1 to &quot;count&quot; to keep track of how many times the user has guessed a letter correctly. | . Testing | 1 | 1 | The response describes two different calls to a procedure that results in different code being executed. The user inputs the number &quot;1&quot; and the letter &quot;h&quot; when the word to be guessed is &quot;hello&quot;. The conditions being tested are the number &quot;1&quot; not being found in &quot;hello&quot; and the letter &quot;h&quot; being found in &quot;hello&quot;. The results of the two calls are false for the first call and true for the second call. | . . Submission 3 . Reporting Category Student Score College Board Score Comments &lt;/tr&gt; Program Purpose and Function | 1 | 1 | The video shows an app that helps with memorization or learning something new by displaying general information, such as the state flag, area, and population, of a selected state from a drop-down list, and allowing the user to select more information. The input is the selected state and the chosen information, the output is the general information and the selected information displayed on the screen. | . Data Abstraction | 0 | 0 | Two code segments are provided, the second one shows data being stored in a list named stateList, containing all the information the user will see on the general information screen like State name, Flag, Population, Capital, and Population. However, the code fragment provided only shows the state name stored in the list. | . Managing Complexity | 0 | 0 | The response includes code that uses lists to manage complexity, but it does not explain how the code would be more complex or inefficient without them. The response states that it would take a long time and be inefficient without the use of a list. | . Procedural Abstraction | 0 | 0 | The response includes a student-developed procedure &quot;updateScreen&quot; but it does not have any parameter and it is not called in the second code segment. The response describes the procedure inaccurately as it does not update the state screen but only sets an index and does not explain how it contributes to the overall functionality of the program. | . Algorithm Implementation | 0 | 0 | The response partially explains the algorithm in the procedure &quot;updateScreen&quot; which includes sequencing and selection using if/else statements, but does not include iteration. The algorithm uses else if statements to narrow down the user&#39;s selected state and sets the index value based on the match, but the response does not explain the specific value set for each U.S. state. | . Testing | 0 | 0 | The response describes two calls from the specified procedure, but it is not an implicit parameter, it is assigned after the call is made. It describes the two separate operations the user performs, not the conditions being tested by the given parameter. The response does not specify the results of the two calls, but the results that appear on the screen. | . . Submission 4 . Reporting Category Student Score College Board Score Comments &lt;/tr&gt; Program Purpose and Function | 1 | 1 | The video demonstrates a program that allows the user to control a boat&#39;s movement and catch fish, with the purpose of lessening boredom. The input is the user pressing keys &#39;a&#39; and &#39;d&#39; and the output is the boat&#39;s left and right movement. The video also includes scorekeeping for total score and tracking the amount of each fish caught in time. | . Data Abstraction | 1 | 1 | The response explains that a list called fishtypes is used to store information about the types of fish caught, and the number of each type caught. The code also shows that this data is accessed in a for loop. | . Managing Complexity | 1 | 1 | The response includes a list of lists that manages complexity by storing fish data, including type and number caught. The response explains that the code can be written without lists by creating new variables for each added fish, but this would be less efficient and would require more changes to the program. | . Procedural Abstraction | 1 | 1 | The response includes a student-developed procedure, &quot;clone+movement+range,&quot; that uses five parameters. The procedure determines where a clone of a sprite spawns, how far it can move, and where it goes when it reaches the end of the screen. The procedure makes the game more challenging by causing each fish clone to spawn and move randomly at a range of speeds or height. | . Algorithm Implementation | 1 | 1 | The response describes a procedure called &quot;clone+movement+range&quot; which uses sequencing, selection, and iteration to determine the spawning, movement, and end positions of a clone sprite. The procedure starts by moving a newly spawned clone to a random x position within the screen and a random height within a range specified by the ‘y1’ and ‘y2’ parameters. Then, a loop begins until either the game ends or the clone touches the hook. Inside the loop, there is an if-else statement where if the clone touches the edge of the right side of the screen, the clone would teleport left to a position specified by the ‘rt state’ (return state) and to random height within a range specified by ‘y1’ and ‘y2’ parameters. | . Testing | 0 | 0 | The response does not specify the arguments passed to the procedure and how they affect the procedure&#39;s behavior. Instead, it explains alternative coding segments that could be used. The response describes conditions being tested, but it does not correspond to how the parameters are used in the program. The response also describes the code segments rather than the result of the procedure call. | . .",

Hacks . The Big Picture purpose of this hack is to build a database. Being able to create an SQLite table and populate test data within it is the major goal. To do this effectively it is imperative to show the following. . Build Schema for a table, make a new model file and use users.py as an example. Start slow and simple and build up. | Build an initXXXXX() method and use it to add preliminary/test data to the table. Once again use users.py as an example. | Make a 30-60 second video where you show a Debugging session of making new rows in the table. Use sqlite marketplace tools and/or sqlite3 command line tool to show success in creating table and adding data. | Hack Helper . Here are some tips. . Become familiar with initUsers(). Observe it is called/activated from main.py. This function activates after you run the main.py and activate the web application in the browser. Observe that the sqlite.db file will appear in the volumes directory in conjunction with home screen of site appearing in browser. . | Delete sqlite.db from volumes directory on your development machine. Set breakpoint on initUsers() and run main.py using debug. Use the step into option on the debugger and observe the creation of data. . | . @app.before_first_request def activate_job():initJokes() initUsers() . Make your own XXXXX.py file under model directory. Follow users.py and develop your own schema from the OOP code you did in last Hacks. Follow the pattern in users.py to make a initXXXX() function top populate some test data. . | In main.py, add your initXXXX() method to def activate_job() function shown above. Use this as basis of your video debugging session. Debugging is hugely important at this level to understand your database success prior to building an API. Building initXXXX() method, adding database records, and debugging will enable you to verify CRUD operations as you develop. . | .",

Reporting Category Student Score College Board Score Comments &lt;/tr&gt; Program Purpose and Function | 0 | 0 | The purpose of the program is stated as &quot;for you to see all the animals and to identify them when you&#39;re asked later&quot; but it does not state the problem being solved or creative interest being pursued. The response also does not accurately describe the functionality demonstrated in the video and confuses input and output. | . Data Abstraction | 0 | 0 | Two code segments are provided, one showing storage of data in a list named animalImages, and the other showing another list named animalList. However, animalList is not used in either code segment. The response describes the data contained in animalList, but it also describes the images from animalImages, which are stated to be in the list. | . Managing Complexity | 0 | 0 | The response does not include a program code segment that uses a list to manage complexity. Both code segments show data being stored in a list, but neither contain code using a list. The code is not complex. The response also does not explain how the list manages complexity, it just states that the array allows you to store more than one variable making it shorter and more complex, but it does not explain how it would be written differently without the list. | . Procedural Abstraction | 0 | 0 | The response includes a student-developed procedure called evaluateGuess with one explicit parameter, guess, and a call to this procedure in a second code segment using the argument guess. The response describes the functionality of the procedure as determining if the user&#39;s guess is right or wrong. However, the response does not describe how this procedure contributes to the overall functionality of the program. | . Algorithm Implementation | 0 | 0 | The student-developed algorithm within the procedure, evaluateGuess, includes sequencing, iteration (a for loop) and selection (an if statement). The response provides a minimal description of the algorithm, but it does not provide enough detail for someone to recreate it. | . Testing | 1 | 1 | The first call is for &quot;dog&quot; which is a correct guess. The second call is for &quot;mouse&quot; which is an incorrect guess. The response also describes the conditions being tested in the procedure, which are whether the guess is equal to one of the animals in animalList or not. The response also states the different results of the two calls, the first call results in &quot;You got a point!&quot; and the second call results in &quot;That&#39;s 1 strike.&quot; | . . Submission 2 . Reporting Category Student Score College Board Score Comments &lt;/tr&gt; Program Purpose and Function | 1 | 1 | The purpose of the program is specified as to explore the user&#39;s creativity through the expression of poetry using their words. The response also describes the functionality, showing the poems according to the user&#39;s inputs of words and setting of articles, resulting in multiple different poems with different word orders and another generation of poems with different words and no articles. The response also describes the input and output of the program. | . Data Abstraction | 1 | 1 | Two code segments are provided, the first shows data being stored in a list named nounList and the second shows the data being accessed from the list under a new name, wordList, since it is passed as a parameter. The response identifies what is stored in the list, stating that the data contains nouns that must be in certain specific locations within the poem to make logical sense. | . Managing Complexity | 1 | 1 | The response includes code that uses lists of words to manage complexity when generating poetry. It mentions that without the list, the noun inputs would have to be stored in different variables and would have to be invoked separately. Another method would have to be used to randomize selection such as generating a random integer, which would require writing individual statements for each possible int generated and making the code more cluttered. | . Procedural Abstraction | 1 | 1 | The response includes a student-developed procedure called createPoems, with four parameters that are used in the procedure. The response also describes how the procedure contributes to the overall program by stating that it is used in conjunction with the user inputs and builds poems according to how many poems the user specified and whether the user wanted articles in the poems. | . Algorithm Implementation | 1 | 1 | The student-developed algorithm within the procedure, createPoems, includes sequencing, selection (if statement), and iteration (while loop). The response explains in detail how the algorithm works, it sequentially first defines a variable to count the number of poems generated and defines an empty string, then it has iteration that generates as many poems as the user specified by running through the selection statements which call articlePoem or noArticlePoem each time. | . Testing | 1 | 1 | The response describes two calls to a specific procedure, createPoems, that result in different code being executed by varying the argument for the last parameter. The first call is createPoems(nounList, verbList, adverbList, 1) and the second call is createPoems(nounList, verbList, adverbList, 0). The last parameter represents the article preference setting. The response describes the conditions being tested by the code, which are whether the user input is 1 or 0 for the article preference setting. | . . Submission 3 . Reporting Category Student Score College Board Score Comments &lt;/tr&gt; Program Purpose and Function | 1 | 0 | The video demonstrates a program that allows the user to select two Marvel characters from a drop-down menu, displaying their rankings and the winner of the battle using an image. The response describes the program&#39;s function, functionality demonstrated in the video, input and output. The response describes the input as the different button clicks to change the screens and the character names selected from each drop-down box. | . Data Abstraction | 1 | 1 | Two code segments are provided, the first showing data being stored in a list named firstCharacterList and the second accessing the data from that list in a loop. The response identifies the data stored in the list as the power rankings and URL for the image of a character selected from a drop-down box. | . Managing Complexity | 1 | 1 | The response includes a list that combines six rankings and an image URL for a character into one collection, managing complexity in the program code. The response explains that the list condenses the code, and without it the program would need more parameters and more steps to find the winner. | . Procedural Abstraction | 1 | 1 | The response describes a procedure called findWinner that compares the average power rankings of two Marvel characters passed as parameters. The procedure changes the winner screen to display the character with the higher average and if the averages are the same, it displays a &quot;tie&quot; image. The procedure contributes to the overall program by determining the hypothetical winner in a battle between characters. | . Algorithm Implementation | 1 | 1 | The student-developed algorithm in the findWinner procedure uses sequencing, selection, and iteration to compare the average power rankings of two characters selected from a drop-down menu. The algorithm iterates through the list of each character, sums up the rankings, and divides by 6 to get the average. It then compares the averages using a conditional statement to determine the winner and display their name and image on the winner screen. | . Testing | 1 | 1 | The response describes two calls to a procedure, findWinner, with different arguments (Vision and Bishop; Carnage and Venom) that lead to different results. The response explains how the procedure uses an if-else statement to determine the winner based on average ranking and displays the winner&#39;s image and name or a tie image. | . . Submission 4 . Reporting Category Student Score College Board Score Comments &lt;/tr&gt; Program Purpose and Function | 1 | 1 | The video demonstrates a program that tests critical thinking skills by collecting input through a text entry field for guessing an 8-letter word, and displays the matching letters. The user inputs words, correctly guessing &quot;touching&quot; in 4 tries, but failing to guess &quot;sandwich&quot; in 6 tries. The input is a word the user inputs, and the output is the color scheme of the corresponding letters. | . Data Abstraction | 0 | 0 | Two code segments are provided, the first shows data being stored in a list named &#39;guesses&#39; but in the second segment, data stored in the list is not being used, only the length of the list is accessed. The response states that the data in the list represents all the user&#39;s word inputs. | . Managing Complexity | 1 | 0 | The response describes a program code segment that uses a list named &quot;guesses&quot; to keep track of the user&#39;s guesses, but the list is not used to manage complexity and can be replaced with a single counter variable. The response does not explain how the list manages complexity and instead mentions that the list&#39;s purpose is to stop the game after 6 guesses. | . Procedural Abstraction | 1 | 1 | The response includes a student-developed procedure, isitcorrect, which compares a user input guess to the correct word or letter positions. The procedure is called in the program with the argument answer. The procedure checks the user&#39;s answer every time they input a guess and contributes to the overall program. | . Algorithm Implementation | 1 | 1 | The response describes a student-developed algorithm called isitcorrect that includes sequencing, selection, and iteration. The algorithm checks if a user&#39;s input is 8 letters, if so it checks for position and accuracy of each letter, turning the output letters green, yellow or red accordingly, it also determines when the &#39;You Win&#39; or &#39;You Lose&#39; screen will show up based on the input. | . Testing | 0 | 0 | The response describes the conditions being tested in a procedure, specifically &quot;whether or not the user inputs the right letter in the right position&quot; and &quot;whether or not the user inputs the right letter in the wrong position.&quot; It also describes the result of these conditions, with the letter color changing to green or yellow respectively. The response does not provide specific arguments used in the procedure call. | . .",

In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), a class is a blueprint for creating an Object. (a data structure). An Object is used like many other Python variables. | A Class has ... a collection of data, these are called Attributes and in Python are pre-fixed using the keyword self | a collection of Functions/Procedures. These are called *Methods when they exist inside a Class definition. | . | An Object is created from the Class/Template.

This enables developers to reference/get instance data in a shorthand fashion (object.name versus object.get_name()) | @name.setter decorator (aka setter). This enables developers to update/set instance data in a shorthand fashion (object.name = &quot;John&quot; versus object.set_name(&quot;John&quot;)) | observe all instance data (self._name, self.email ...) are prefixed with &quot;&quot;, this convention allows setters and getters to work with more natural variable name (name, email ...) | . | .

The purpose was there (simulated John Conways Game of Life.) Describes how the code is functioning. States the input for the program and output for the program. | . Data Abstraction | 1 | 1 | Their answer includes 2 program code segments with 1 storing data and the other is a part of fullfilling the programs purpose. They also identify the variable used (startGrid.) They also describe how the data is stored:the status of one of the 10,800(120 x 90) possible cells on screen. A 0 being dead, and a 1 being alive. | . Managing Complexity | 1 | 1 | They use a code segment that manages complexity by using a list to store all of the data in one place. The list makes it easier to keep track of the data and easily change data. The explanation is also very detailed about how the code manages complexity. | . Procedural Abstraction | 1 | 1 | They deserve a 2 because they include a student created procedure with 2 parameters (current and replacement) and they also createcd a code segment that defined what was being call in the above procedure. They also include the functionality of the procedure in the response by saying, &quot;This procedure takes as inputs identifying numbers for two lists. The first will be copied over to replace the second.&quot; | . Algorithm Implementation | 1 | 1 | The student uses sequencing, selection (if statement), and iteration (repeat loop) in their student developed algorithm. Their explanation is good enough to where some one would be able to recreate their code. They state, &quot;The algorithm uses nested if-else statements to identify which list will be copied from, by looking at the first parameter. Inside the if statement matching that parameter, are another set of if statements to determine where the list should be copied over to.&quot; | . .",

There are 4 types of algorithms, 1 step, 2 step, 3 step, and 4 step | An example of a 1 step is: 2 * n | An example of a 2 step is: 2^n | An example of a 3 step is: (2 * n)^2 | An example of a 4 step is: 5! = 5 4 3 2 1 = 120 | There are problems that computers cannot solve | If a computer can solve a problem it may take an unreasonable amount of time | Undecidable problem: problems for which no algorithms can be built that can provide a correct yes or no answer or a solution | Decidable problem: problems for which algorthms could be written to solve/produce a correct output for all inputs. | . HACK 1 . Please write a short 1-2 sentence explanation describing the difference between decidable and undecidable problems. Make sure to provide at least one example of each. . The difference between an decidable problem and an undecidable problem is that an undecidable problem has no algorithms that provide a solution whereas a decidable problem has algorithms that are solutions. | . def ben(): z = 0 i = 1 while z != 1: i = i + 1 print(i) ben() . vardaan = 5 if vardaan &gt; 10: print(&quot;greater than 10&quot;) else: print(&quot;not greater than 10&quot;) . HACK 2 . Which of the following is a 3 step algorithm? . A. 2 x 6 x 8 . B. 4^5 . C. (3 x 8)^2 . This is the answer because there is 3 steps (3 x 8) and then you have to put it to the power of 2, which is another 2 steps (24 x 2 x 2) this makes a total of 3 steps. | . D. None of the above . E. All of the above . HACK 3: Rewrite this JavaScript Code in a More Efficient Way (Hint: Use Binary Search) . function peak_finder(array){ let counter = 0 let peak = 0 let peak_index =0 while (counter &lt;= array.length){ console.log(counter) if (counter === 0){ if (a[0]&gt;=a[1]){ peak = a[0] peak_index = counter counter = array.length return `The ${counter-1} indexed number, ${peak} is a peak` }else{ counter+=1 } }else if(counter === array.length-1){ if (a[array.length-1] &gt;= a[array.length-2]){ peak = a[array.length-1] peak_index = counter counter = array.length return `The ${counter-1} indexed number, ${peak} is a peak` } }else{ if (a[counter]&gt; a[counter+1] &amp;&amp; a[counter]&gt; a[counter-1]){ peak = a[counter] peak_index = counter counter = array.length return `The ${counter-1} indexed number, ${peak} is a peak` }else{ counter += 1 } } } } .

Rewritten One . This was hard to do because I am not too good at JavaScript, so I used what I new and made the code more efficient with binary search | .

Instead of having all of the extra code I simply used a sort function to sort the data. | . HACK 5: Rewrite this Python Code in a More Efficient Way . from itertools import permutations perm = permutations([1, 2, 3]) for i in list(perm): print (i) . (1, 2, 3) (1, 3, 2) (2, 1, 3) (2, 3, 1) (3, 1, 2) (3, 2, 1) . This version of the function uses an in-place algorithm, which means that it does not create a new list for each permutation. | . Blog/Final Thoughts . Found out there are undecidable problems are | Also found out what a 1 step, 2 step, and 4 step, functions are | These were things that I did not even no about before | For creating the more effiecient code I understood it a little, but it was pretty hard to understand what to do, at least for #3 | Hack 3 and 5 for probably the hardest and 3 was pretty confusing | Also learned how to make code more effective and simplify it | .

Binary search is more efficient than sequential search because sequential search goes one by one in the list comparing each value to the value you are looking for.

Chicken Alfredo to much meat and takes too long to prepare You can make Cheese Quesadilla. Beef Wellington to much meat and takes too long to prepare . Exercise 2 . Make a flowchart(here is one we used) and write pseudocode for the following scenario. . Mr. Yeung would like to grade live reviews. | He wants to see if each student has at least 2 issues on their project. If they don&#39;t they receive a score of 2.0. | If they have at least 2 issues, check that they have completed at least 5 of their scrumboard tasks. | If they have completed 5 scrumboard tasks, give the student a 2.7. If they have not completed 5 scrumboard tasks, give them a score of 2.5. If they have completed more than 5 tasks, give them a score of 3.0. | How much would a student with 3 issues and 1 complete scrumboard task receive? | . . -They would get 2.0 because they do not have at least 5 tasks completed . Blog/Final Thoughts . For section 3.5 and 3.6 I already understood how to do these taska | They were good though because I was able to get more practice with these ideas | . . 3.7 is where it got a little tricky | Was not able to do it by myself I had to look back at your lesson | Once I reviewed the lesson I was able to understand the code and put it to use | The flowchart though was easy to make | .",

            "content": ". My answer was close because it contained a stribng varible and Boolean variable, which are in the correct answer. My answer was wrong because the names of the variables were not meaningful. C is the correct answer because it uses a string variable and a Boolean variable, the Boolean variable is important because it tells us if the statement is true or false (absent or not.) The named also used for the variable works well because they are appropriate and easy to read. . . I chose C because I narrowed it down to two answers (C and D) and I went with C. I knew it was one of those because the 7th line tells us a = 21, the 6th lines tells us b = 40, and the thrid line tells us c = 30. I said d = 40 because I could not figure out where else it was said, so I went with line 4. I now understand my mistake because I added c and d (30+40) and then divided by 2 so I got 35, which made me confused. I realized I had to do d divided by 2 and then add c (40/2=20+30) to get an answer of 50. . . The first part of the answer I selected was wrong, but the second part of it was correct. If I were to have ran the code I would have got &quot;onno&quot;, which is not noon. C is the correct answer because it uses the word &quot;on&quot;. The second line is basically reversing the word, so you would get &quot;no&quot; and then add the original word back (&quot;on&quot;) to the end, which would give you the word &quot;noon&quot;. .",

This code planning begins by coming up with some jokes and defining a data &quot;model&quot; to keep and manage the jokes. . jokes_data contains a list of dictionary records containing joke and reactions:haha or boohoo - joke_list contains collection of jokes we will put into jokes_data | . | Next comes some functions to interact with our jokes . def initJokes(): initializes jokes_data | def getJokes(): returns the complete list of jokes | def getJoke(): returns a single joke from our list | ... many more function can be examined by reading comments below ... | . | . import random jokes_data = [] joke_list = [ &quot;If you give someone a program... you will frustrate them for a day; if you teach them how to program... you will &quot; &quot;frustrate them for a lifetime.&quot;, &quot;Q: Why did I divide sin by tan?

Backend Interface for Web API (Control) . An application programming interface (API) is the medium by which different systems of software interact. In our applications we have two big systems:1. Python Backend that stores data beyond a single Web page2. GH Pages/Fastpages Frontend that is responsible for presenting data . To communicate data between Frontend and Backend, this section Backend code provides and interface to the Frontend using a Web Service Endpoint. Examples of endpoints are listed below and can be typed within a browser, which will return JSON data: . https://flask.nighthawkcodingsociety.com/api/jokes | https://flask.nighthawkcodingsociety.com/api/jokes/2 | https://flask.nighthawkcodingsociety.com/api/jokes/random | . As you can see, these Endpoints return JSON. They are NOT that readable by normal humans. However, they are very effective in passing requested data across the Internet. The Frontend code is responsible for formatting and presenting and interface that allows the typical computer user to interact with this data. . The next cell of code is Creating Endpoints that return JSON. This allows developers in the Frontend to interact with Backend data. API is a contract between the Frontend and Backend on how to share data. . FYI, there is NO output from this section . . from flask import Blueprint, jsonify # jsonify creates an endpoint response object from flask_restful import Api, Resource # used for REST API building import requests # used for testing import random # Blueprints allow this code to be procedurally abstracted from main.py, meaning code is not all in one place app_api = Blueprint(&#39;api&#39;, __name__, url_prefix=&#39;/api/jokes&#39;) # endpoint prefix avoid redundantly typing /api/jokes over and over # API generator https://flask-restful.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#id1 api = Api(app_api) class JokesAPI: # not implemented, this would be where we would allow creation of a new Joke class _Create(Resource): def post(self, joke): pass # getJokes() class _Read(Resource): def get(self): return jsonify(getJokes()) # getJoke(id) class _ReadID(Resource): def get(self, id): return jsonify(getJoke(id)) # getRandomJoke() class _ReadRandom(Resource): def get(self): return jsonify(getRandomJoke()) # getRandomJoke() class _ReadCount(Resource): def get(self): count = countJokes() countMsg = {&#39;count&#39;: count} return jsonify(countMsg) # put method: addJokeHaHa class _UpdateLike(Resource): def put(self, id): addJokeHaHa(id) return jsonify(getJoke(id)) # put method: addJokeBooHoo class _UpdateJeer(Resource): def put(self, id): addJokeBooHoo(id) return jsonify(getJoke(id)) # building RESTapi interfaces, these routes are added to Web Server http://&lt;server&lt;/api/jokes api.add_resource(_Create, &#39;/create/&lt;string:joke&gt;&#39;) api.add_resource(_Read, &#39;/&#39;) # default, which returns all jokes api.add_resource(_ReadID, &#39;/&lt;int:id&gt;&#39;) api.add_resource(_ReadRandom, &#39;/random&#39;) api.add_resource(_ReadCount, &#39;/count&#39;) api.add_resource(_UpdateLike, &#39;/like/&lt;int:id&gt;/&#39;) api.add_resource(_UpdateJeer, &#39;/jeer/&lt;int:id&gt;/&#39;) . Frontend (View Simulation) and Hacks . This python codes tests endpoints on a server. This can be handy for development and testing when making modifications to the Jokes Web APIs.

Then repeat this process until you get program working like you want it to work. . menu = {&quot;burger&quot;: 3.99, &quot;fries&quot;: 1.99, &quot;drink&quot;: 0.99, &quot;burger and fries&quot;: 5.98, &quot;burger and drink&quot;: 4.98, &quot;drink and fries&quot;: 2.98} total = 0 #shows the user the menu and prompts them to select an item print(&quot;Menu:&quot;) for k,v in menu.items(): print(k + &quot; $&quot; + str(v)) #why does v have &quot;str&quot; in front of it? #ideally the code should prompt the user multiple times item = input(&quot;Please select an item from the menu&quot;) #code should add the price of the menu items selected by the user print(&quot;&quot;) if item in menu.keys(): print(f&quot;your total will be: {menu[item]}&quot;) print(&quot;Thank you for ordering &quot; + item) print(&quot;Your order with be ready in 15 minutes&quot;) else: print(&quot;That is not on the menu&quot;) # print(&quot;Total=&quot; + &quot; $&quot; + str(v)) . Menu: burger $3.99 fries $1.99 drink $0.99 burger and fries $5.98 burger and drink $4.98 drink and fries $2.98 your total will be: 1.99 Thank you for ordering fries Your order with be ready in 15 minutes . Hacks . Now is a good time to think about Testing of your teams final project... . What errors may arise in your project? | What are some test cases that can be used? | Make sure to document any bugs you encounter and how you solved the problem. | What are “single” tests that you will perform on your project? Or, your part of the project? As Hack Design and Test plan action … Divide these “single” tests into Issues for Scrum Board prior to coding. FYI, related tests could be in same Issue by using markdown checkboxes to separate tests. | . | .",

            "content": "console.log output . Output to console using the classic programming introduction using a &quot;Hello, World!&quot; message. . The command or function is console.log() | &quot;Hello, World&quot; is a String literal. This is the referred to as Static text, as it does not change. | &quot;Hello, World&quot; is a parameter to the console.log command. | The console.log command outputs the parameter to the console, so you can see it in this Jupyter document. | Note, in a Web Application, console.log is used for debugging and is not visible from the browser via HTML. It is used behind the scenes, when using Inspect-&gt;Console from the browser. | . console.log(&quot;Hello, World!&quot;); . Hello, World! . console.log output showing use of variable . This second example is a sequence of code, two or more lines forms a sequence. This example defines a variable, then outputs the msg to terminal. . The variable &quot;var msg =&quot; is used to capture the data | The console.log(msg) outputs to console | . var msg = &quot;James&quot;; console.log(msg); . James . console.log output showing use of a function . This example passes the previously defined variable &quot;msg&quot; to the newly defined &quot;function logIt(output)&quot;. . There are two steps in the code, the definition of the function and the call to the function. &quot;function logIt(output) {}&quot; and everything between curly braces is the definitions of the function. | &quot;logIt(msg)&quot; is the call to the function, this actually activates the function. If you remove this line you will not receive any output to console. | . | Since the variable &quot;msg&quot; was defined in previous cell, it is used a parameter when calling the logMessage function. | . function logIt(output) { console.log(output); } logIt(&quot;foo bar&quot;); . foo bar . Showing reuse of a function . Now that a function is defined, it can be called from any of the subsequent cell in the Jupyter notebook. A function/method, is a process of creating a procedural abstraction. This a programming practice to promote reuse versus coding the same thing over and over. . First call sends a different string message | Second call sends a number | . console.log(&quot;Reuse of logIT&quot;) logIt(&quot;Hello, Students!&quot;); logIt(2022) . Reuse of logIT Hello, Students! 2022 . Dynamic or Loosely typed language (string, number) . JavaScript is a loosely typed language, meaning you don&#39;t have to specify what type of information will be stored in a variable in advance. The variable type is determined at runtime. This is similar to Python and most interpretive languages. Java which is a compiled language is strongly typed, thus you will see string, integer, double, and object in the source code. In JavaScript, the &quot;typeof&quot; keyword returns the type. . function logItType(output) { console.log(typeof output, &quot;;&quot;, output); } console.log(&quot;Looking at dynamic nature of types in JavaScript&quot;) logItType(&quot;hello&quot;); // String logItType(2020); // Number logItType([1, 2, 3]); // Object is generic for this Array, which similar to Python List . Looking at dynamic nature of types in JavaScript string ; hello number ; 2020 object ; [ 1, 2, 3 ] . Build a Person Function/Class object and JSON . JavaScript functions have special properties and syntax is shown in many ways. In fact, a Class in JavaScript is a special function. Jupyter Notebooks seems to be more friendly to &quot;function&quot; definitions versus &quot;Class&quot;, thus this lesson uses &quot;function&quot; and &quot;prototype&quot; versus &quot;Class&quot;. . Definition of function allows for a collection of data, the &quot;function Person&quot; allows programmer to retain name, github id, and class of designation. | Definition of a prototype allow for the definition of a method associated with the function , the &quot;Person.prototype.toJSON&quot; allows the collection of data to be expressed in a json/string versus JavaScript object. | Instance of a function, the &quot;var teacher = new Person(&quot;Mr M&quot;, &quot;jm1021&quot;, 1977)&quot; line makes a variable &quot;teacher&quot; which is an object representation of &quot;function Person&quot;. | . // define a function to hold data for a Person function Person(name, ghID, classOf, sport) { this.name = name; this.ghID = ghID; this.classOf = classOf; this.sport = sport; this.role = &quot;&quot;; } // define a setter for role in Person data Person.prototype.setRole = function(role) { this.role = role; } // define a JSON conversion &quot;method&quot; associated with Person Person.prototype.toJSON = function() { const obj = {name: this.name, ghID: this.ghID, classOf: this.classOf, role: this.role, sport: this.sport,}; const json = JSON.stringify(obj); return json; } // make a new Person and assign to variable teacher var teacher = new Person(&quot;Mr M&quot;, &quot;jm1021&quot;, 1977, &quot;coding&quot;); teacher.setRole(&quot;Teacher&quot;); // output of Object and JSON/string associated with Teacher logItType(teacher); // object type is easy to work with in JavaScript logItType(teacher.toJSON()); // json/string is useful when passing data on internet . object ; Person { name: &#39;Mr M&#39;, ghID: &#39;jm1021&#39;, classOf: 1977, sport: &#39;coding&#39;, role: &#39;Teacher&#39; } string ; {&#34;name&#34;:&#34;Mr M&#34;,&#34;ghID&#34;:&#34;jm1021&#34;,&#34;classOf&#34;:1977,&#34;role&#34;:&#34;Teacher&#34;,&#34;sport&#34;:&#34;coding&#34;} . Build a Classroom Array/List of Persons and JSON . Many key elements are shown again. New elements include... .

IJavaScript and Table formatting using toHTML method . This example builds a Classroom method _toHTML which is passed to the IJavaScript interpreter $$.html which renders output similarly to a real website. . JavaScript in the _toHTML method is broken into three parts... Style part is building CSS inline formatting | Body part is constructing the Table Rows (tr), Table Headings (th), and Table Data (td). The table data is obtained from a Classroom object. The JavaScript for loop allows the construction of a new row of data for each person object in the Array. | Return part creates the HTML fragment for rendering | . | The last line in the example $$.html is IJavaScript HTML interpreter and by passing the parameter of the _toHTML method it obtains HTML to render | . // define an HTML conversion &quot;method&quot; associated with Classroom Classroom.prototype._toHtml = function() { // HTML Style is build using inline structure var style = ( &quot;display:inline-block;&quot; + &quot;background:black;&quot; + &quot;border: 2px solid grey;&quot; + &quot;box-shadow: 0.8em 0.4em 0.4em grey;&quot; ); // HTML Body of Table is build as a series of concatenations (+=) var body = &quot;&quot;; // Heading for Array Columns body += &quot;&lt;tr&gt;&quot;; body += &quot;&lt;th&gt;&lt;mark&gt;&quot; + &quot;Name&quot; + &quot;&lt;/mark&gt;&lt;/th&gt;&quot;; body += &quot;&lt;th&gt;&lt;mark&gt;&quot; + &quot;GitHub ID&quot; + &quot;&lt;/mark&gt;&lt;/th&gt;&quot;; body += &quot;&lt;th&gt;&lt;mark&gt;&quot; + &quot;Role&quot; + &quot;&lt;/mark&gt;&lt;/th&gt;&quot;; body += &quot;&lt;th&gt;&lt;mark&gt;&quot; + &quot;Sport&quot; + &quot;&lt;/mark&gt;&lt;/th&gt;&quot;; body += &quot;&lt;/tr&gt;&quot;; // Data of Array, iterate through each row of compsci.classroom for (var row of compsci.classroom) { // tr for each row, a new line body += &quot;&lt;tr&gt;&quot;; // td for each column of data body += &quot;&lt;td&gt;&quot; + row.name + &quot;&lt;/td&gt;&quot;; body += &quot;&lt;td&gt;&quot; + row.ghID + &quot;&lt;/td&gt;&quot;; body += &quot;&lt;td&gt;&quot; + row.role + &quot;&lt;/td&gt;&quot;; body += &quot;&lt;td&gt;&quot; + row.sport + &quot;&lt;/td&gt;&quot;; // tr to end line body += &quot;&lt;tr&gt;&quot;; } // Build and HTML fragment of div, table, table body return ( &quot;&lt;div style=&#39;&quot; + style + &quot;&#39;&gt;&quot; + &quot;&lt;table&gt;&quot; + body + &quot;&lt;/table&gt;&quot; + &quot;&lt;/div&gt;&quot; ); }; // IJavaScript HTML processor receive parameter of defined HTML fragment $$.html(compsci._toHtml()); .

Drafting: . For my code I used a simple repeating command “on event (“Button name”,”click”, function(){“ (This was used throughout my whole quiz) I wanted to create a question that requires them to type in the answer (code below) . onEvent(“enter”, “click”, function( ) { console.log(“answerbutton entered text: “ + getText(“text-input”)); if (getText(“text-input”) == “Ronaldo”) { setScreen(“end”); } else { setScreen(“incorrect”); } }); . Data Abstraction . An example of Data Abstraction in this program is the “font size” chart. It holds multiple selections that represent different sizes. A random number function takes a random size selection from the list and sets the default font size to that selection. . The point . The point of the assignment was to get comfortable with code.org but specifically java script. . # Managing Complexity . An example of complexity management in this quiz is the layout. The quiz is divided into two parts: pasword and exploration in the program. This can easily be seen in the first part of the code, each command has its own defined function. . Challenges . Since I created a Jeopardy game there were lots of buttons that I had to create so I had to make sure the names were correct, so I could easily find them, I also had a little trouble while making a question with text entry. .",

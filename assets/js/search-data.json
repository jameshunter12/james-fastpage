There are 4 types of algorithms, 1 step, 2 step, 3 step, and 4 step | An example of a 1 step is: 2 * n | An example of a 2 step is: 2^n | An example of a 3 step is: (2 * n)^2 | An example of a 4 step is: 5! = 5 4 3 2 1 = 120 | There are problems that computers cannot solve | If a computer can solve a problem it may take an unreasonable amount of time | Undecidable problem: problems for which no algorithms can be built that can provide a correct yes or no answer or a solution | Decidable problem: problems for which algorthms could be written to solve/produce a correct output for all inputs. | . HACK 1 . Please write a short 1-2 sentence explanation describing the difference between decidable and undecidable problems. Make sure to provide at least one example of each. . The difference between an decidable problem and an undecidable problem is that an undecidable problem has no algorithms that provide a solution whereas a decidable problem has algorithms that are solutions. | . def ben(): z = 0 i = 1 while z != 1: i = i + 1 print(i) ben() . vardaan = 5 if vardaan &gt; 10: print(&quot;greater than 10&quot;) else: print(&quot;not greater than 10&quot;) . HACK 2 . Which of the following is a 3 step algorithm? . A. 2 x 6 x 8 . B. 4^5 . C. (3 x 8)^2 . This is the answer because there is 3 steps (3 x 8) and then you have to put it to the power of 2, which is another 2 steps (24 x 2 x 2) this makes a total of 3 steps. | . D. None of the above . E. All of the above . HACK 3: Rewrite this JavaScript Code in a More Efficient Way (Hint: Use Binary Search) . function peak_finder(array){ let counter = 0 let peak = 0 let peak_index =0 while (counter &lt;= array.length){ console.log(counter) if (counter === 0){ if (a[0]&gt;=a[1]){ peak = a[0] peak_index = counter counter = array.length return `The ${counter-1} indexed number, ${peak} is a peak` }else{ counter+=1 } }else if(counter === array.length-1){ if (a[array.length-1] &gt;= a[array.length-2]){ peak = a[array.length-1] peak_index = counter counter = array.length return `The ${counter-1} indexed number, ${peak} is a peak` } }else{ if (a[counter]&gt; a[counter+1] &amp;&amp; a[counter]&gt; a[counter-1]){ peak = a[counter] peak_index = counter counter = array.length return `The ${counter-1} indexed number, ${peak} is a peak` }else{ counter += 1 } } } } .

Instead of having all of the extra code I simply used a sort function to sort the data. | . HACK 5: Rewrite this Python Code in a More Efficient Way . from itertools import permutations perm = permutations([1, 2, 3]) for i in list(perm): print (i) . (1, 2, 3) (1, 3, 2) (2, 1, 3) (2, 3, 1) (3, 1, 2) (3, 2, 1) . This version of the function uses an in-place algorithm, which means that it does not create a new list for each permutation. | . Blog/Final Thoughts . Found out there are undecidable problems are | Also found out what a 1 step, 2 step, and 4 step, functions are | These were things that I did not even no about before | For creating the more effiecient code I understood it a little, but it was pretty hard to understand what to do, at least for #3 | Hack 3 and 5 for probably the hardest and 3 was pretty confusing | Also learned how to make code more effective and simplify it | .

Using sequential search you would go through the list comparing 69 to every value in the list until the number (69) matches 69. In the order this list is it will take 7 iterations to find 69 | Using binary search you would start in the middle, you can find this by adding the first and last last ((1+8)/2=4.5).

Explain why Binary Search is more efficient than Sequential Search . Binary search is more efficient than sequential search because sequential search goes one by one in the list comparing each value to the value you are looking for.

            "content": ". My answer was close because it contained a stribng varible and Boolean variable, which are in the correct answer. My answer was wrong because the names of the variables were not meaningful. C is the correct answer because it uses a string variable and a Boolean variable, the Boolean variable is important because it tells us if the statement is true or false (absent or not.) The named also used for the variable works well because they are appropriate and easy to read. . . I chose C because I narrowed it down to two answers (C and D) and I went with C. I knew it was one of those because the 7th line tells us a = 21, the 6th lines tells us b = 40, and the thrid line tells us c = 30. I said d = 40 because I could not figure out where else it was said, so I went with line 4. I now understand my mistake because I added c and d (30+40) and then divided by 2 so I got 35, which made me confused. I realized I had to do d divided by 2 and then add c (40/2=20+30) to get an answer of 50. . . The first part of the answer I selected was wrong, but the second part of it was correct. If I were to have ran the code I would have got &quot;onno&quot;, which is not noon. C is the correct answer because it uses the word &quot;on&quot;. The second line is basically reversing the word, so you would get &quot;no&quot; and then add the original word back (&quot;on&quot;) to the end, which would give you the word &quot;noon&quot;. .",

Backend Interface for Web API (Control) . An application programming interface (API) is the medium by which different systems of software interact. In our applications we have two big systems:1. Python Backend that stores data beyond a single Web page2. GH Pages/Fastpages Frontend that is responsible for presenting data . To communicate data between Frontend and Backend, this section Backend code provides and interface to the Frontend using a Web Service Endpoint. Examples of endpoints are listed below and can be typed within a browser, which will return JSON data: . https://flask.nighthawkcodingsociety.com/api/jokes | https://flask.nighthawkcodingsociety.com/api/jokes/2 | https://flask.nighthawkcodingsociety.com/api/jokes/random | . As you can see, these Endpoints return JSON. They are NOT that readable by normal humans. However, they are very effective in passing requested data across the Internet. The Frontend code is responsible for formatting and presenting and interface that allows the typical computer user to interact with this data. . The next cell of code is Creating Endpoints that return JSON. This allows developers in the Frontend to interact with Backend data. API is a contract between the Frontend and Backend on how to share data. . FYI, there is NO output from this section . . from flask import Blueprint, jsonify # jsonify creates an endpoint response object from flask_restful import Api, Resource # used for REST API building import requests # used for testing import random # Blueprints allow this code to be procedurally abstracted from main.py, meaning code is not all in one place app_api = Blueprint(&#39;api&#39;, __name__, url_prefix=&#39;/api/jokes&#39;) # endpoint prefix avoid redundantly typing /api/jokes over and over # API generator https://flask-restful.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#id1 api = Api(app_api) class JokesAPI: # not implemented, this would be where we would allow creation of a new Joke class _Create(Resource): def post(self, joke): pass # getJokes() class _Read(Resource): def get(self): return jsonify(getJokes()) # getJoke(id) class _ReadID(Resource): def get(self, id): return jsonify(getJoke(id)) # getRandomJoke() class _ReadRandom(Resource): def get(self): return jsonify(getRandomJoke()) # getRandomJoke() class _ReadCount(Resource): def get(self): count = countJokes() countMsg = {&#39;count&#39;: count} return jsonify(countMsg) # put method: addJokeHaHa class _UpdateLike(Resource): def put(self, id): addJokeHaHa(id) return jsonify(getJoke(id)) # put method: addJokeBooHoo class _UpdateJeer(Resource): def put(self, id): addJokeBooHoo(id) return jsonify(getJoke(id)) # building RESTapi interfaces, these routes are added to Web Server http://&lt;server&lt;/api/jokes api.add_resource(_Create, &#39;/create/&lt;string:joke&gt;&#39;) api.add_resource(_Read, &#39;/&#39;) # default, which returns all jokes api.add_resource(_ReadID, &#39;/&lt;int:id&gt;&#39;) api.add_resource(_ReadRandom, &#39;/random&#39;) api.add_resource(_ReadCount, &#39;/count&#39;) api.add_resource(_UpdateLike, &#39;/like/&lt;int:id&gt;/&#39;) api.add_resource(_UpdateJeer, &#39;/jeer/&lt;int:id&gt;/&#39;) .

Then repeat this process until you get program working like you want it to work. . menu = {&quot;burger&quot;: 3.99, &quot;fries&quot;: 1.99, &quot;drink&quot;: 0.99, &quot;burger and fries&quot;: 5.98, &quot;burger and drink&quot;: 4.98, &quot;drink and fries&quot;: 2.98} total = 0 #shows the user the menu and prompts them to select an item print(&quot;Menu:&quot;) for k,v in menu.items(): print(k + &quot; $&quot; + str(v)) #why does v have &quot;str&quot; in front of it? #ideally the code should prompt the user multiple times item = input(&quot;Please select an item from the menu&quot;) #code should add the price of the menu items selected by the user print(&quot;&quot;) if item in menu.keys(): print(f&quot;your total will be: {menu[item]}&quot;) print(&quot;Thank you for ordering &quot; + item) print(&quot;Your order with be ready in 15 minutes&quot;) else: print(&quot;That is not on the menu&quot;) # print(&quot;Total=&quot; + &quot; $&quot; + str(v)) . Menu: burger $3.99 fries $1.99 drink $0.99 burger and fries $5.98 burger and drink $4.98 drink and fries $2.98 your total will be: 1.99 Thank you for ordering fries Your order with be ready in 15 minutes . Hacks . Now is a good time to think about Testing of your teams final project... . What errors may arise in your project? | What are some test cases that can be used? | Make sure to document any bugs you encounter and how you solved the problem. | What are “single” tests that you will perform on your project? Or, your part of the project? As Hack Design and Test plan action … Divide these “single” tests into Issues for Scrum Board prior to coding. FYI, related tests could be in same Issue by using markdown checkboxes to separate tests. | . | .",

            "content": "console.log output . Output to console using the classic programming introduction using a &quot;Hello, World!&quot; message. . The command or function is console.log() | &quot;Hello, World&quot; is a String literal. This is the referred to as Static text, as it does not change. | &quot;Hello, World&quot; is a parameter to the console.log command. | The console.log command outputs the parameter to the console, so you can see it in this Jupyter document. | Note, in a Web Application, console.log is used for debugging and is not visible from the browser via HTML. It is used behind the scenes, when using Inspect-&gt;Console from the browser. | . console.log(&quot;Hello, World!&quot;); . Hello, World! . console.log output showing use of variable . This second example is a sequence of code, two or more lines forms a sequence. This example defines a variable, then outputs the msg to terminal. . The variable &quot;var msg =&quot; is used to capture the data | The console.log(msg) outputs to console | . var msg = &quot;James&quot;; console.log(msg); . James . console.log output showing use of a function . This example passes the previously defined variable &quot;msg&quot; to the newly defined &quot;function logIt(output)&quot;. . There are two steps in the code, the definition of the function and the call to the function. &quot;function logIt(output) {}&quot; and everything between curly braces is the definitions of the function. | &quot;logIt(msg)&quot; is the call to the function, this actually activates the function. If you remove this line you will not receive any output to console. | . | Since the variable &quot;msg&quot; was defined in previous cell, it is used a parameter when calling the logMessage function. | . function logIt(output) { console.log(output); } logIt(&quot;foo bar&quot;); . foo bar . Showing reuse of a function . Now that a function is defined, it can be called from any of the subsequent cell in the Jupyter notebook. A function/method, is a process of creating a procedural abstraction. This a programming practice to promote reuse versus coding the same thing over and over. . First call sends a different string message | Second call sends a number | . console.log(&quot;Reuse of logIT&quot;) logIt(&quot;Hello, Students!&quot;); logIt(2022) . Reuse of logIT Hello, Students! 2022 . Dynamic or Loosely typed language (string, number) . JavaScript is a loosely typed language, meaning you don&#39;t have to specify what type of information will be stored in a variable in advance. The variable type is determined at runtime. This is similar to Python and most interpretive languages. Java which is a compiled language is strongly typed, thus you will see string, integer, double, and object in the source code. In JavaScript, the &quot;typeof&quot; keyword returns the type. . function logItType(output) { console.log(typeof output, &quot;;&quot;, output); } console.log(&quot;Looking at dynamic nature of types in JavaScript&quot;) logItType(&quot;hello&quot;); // String logItType(2020); // Number logItType([1, 2, 3]); // Object is generic for this Array, which similar to Python List . Looking at dynamic nature of types in JavaScript string ; hello number ; 2020 object ; [ 1, 2, 3 ] . Build a Person Function/Class object and JSON . JavaScript functions have special properties and syntax is shown in many ways. In fact, a Class in JavaScript is a special function. Jupyter Notebooks seems to be more friendly to &quot;function&quot; definitions versus &quot;Class&quot;, thus this lesson uses &quot;function&quot; and &quot;prototype&quot; versus &quot;Class&quot;. . Definition of function allows for a collection of data, the &quot;function Person&quot; allows programmer to retain name, github id, and class of designation. | Definition of a prototype allow for the definition of a method associated with the function , the &quot;Person.prototype.toJSON&quot; allows the collection of data to be expressed in a json/string versus JavaScript object. | Instance of a function, the &quot;var teacher = new Person(&quot;Mr M&quot;, &quot;jm1021&quot;, 1977)&quot; line makes a variable &quot;teacher&quot; which is an object representation of &quot;function Person&quot;. | . // define a function to hold data for a Person function Person(name, ghID, classOf, sport) { this.name = name; this.ghID = ghID; this.classOf = classOf; this.sport = sport; this.role = &quot;&quot;; } // define a setter for role in Person data Person.prototype.setRole = function(role) { this.role = role; } // define a JSON conversion &quot;method&quot; associated with Person Person.prototype.toJSON = function() { const obj = {name: this.name, ghID: this.ghID, classOf: this.classOf, role: this.role, sport: this.sport,}; const json = JSON.stringify(obj); return json; } // make a new Person and assign to variable teacher var teacher = new Person(&quot;Mr M&quot;, &quot;jm1021&quot;, 1977, &quot;coding&quot;); teacher.setRole(&quot;Teacher&quot;); // output of Object and JSON/string associated with Teacher logItType(teacher); // object type is easy to work with in JavaScript logItType(teacher.toJSON()); // json/string is useful when passing data on internet . object ; Person { name: &#39;Mr M&#39;, ghID: &#39;jm1021&#39;, classOf: 1977, sport: &#39;coding&#39;, role: &#39;Teacher&#39; } string ; {&#34;name&#34;:&#34;Mr M&#34;,&#34;ghID&#34;:&#34;jm1021&#34;,&#34;classOf&#34;:1977,&#34;role&#34;:&#34;Teacher&#34;,&#34;sport&#34;:&#34;coding&#34;} .

IJavaScript and Table formatting using toHTML method . This example builds a Classroom method _toHTML which is passed to the IJavaScript interpreter $$.html which renders output similarly to a real website. . JavaScript in the _toHTML method is broken into three parts... Style part is building CSS inline formatting | Body part is constructing the Table Rows (tr), Table Headings (th), and Table Data (td). The table data is obtained from a Classroom object. The JavaScript for loop allows the construction of a new row of data for each person object in the Array. | Return part creates the HTML fragment for rendering | . | The last line in the example $$.html is IJavaScript HTML interpreter and by passing the parameter of the _toHTML method it obtains HTML to render | . // define an HTML conversion &quot;method&quot; associated with Classroom Classroom.prototype._toHtml = function() { // HTML Style is build using inline structure var style = ( &quot;display:inline-block;&quot; + &quot;background:black;&quot; + &quot;border: 2px solid grey;&quot; + &quot;box-shadow: 0.8em 0.4em 0.4em grey;&quot; ); // HTML Body of Table is build as a series of concatenations (+=) var body = &quot;&quot;; // Heading for Array Columns body += &quot;&lt;tr&gt;&quot;; body += &quot;&lt;th&gt;&lt;mark&gt;&quot; + &quot;Name&quot; + &quot;&lt;/mark&gt;&lt;/th&gt;&quot;; body += &quot;&lt;th&gt;&lt;mark&gt;&quot; + &quot;GitHub ID&quot; + &quot;&lt;/mark&gt;&lt;/th&gt;&quot;; body += &quot;&lt;th&gt;&lt;mark&gt;&quot; + &quot;Role&quot; + &quot;&lt;/mark&gt;&lt;/th&gt;&quot;; body += &quot;&lt;th&gt;&lt;mark&gt;&quot; + &quot;Sport&quot; + &quot;&lt;/mark&gt;&lt;/th&gt;&quot;; body += &quot;&lt;/tr&gt;&quot;; // Data of Array, iterate through each row of compsci.classroom for (var row of compsci.classroom) { // tr for each row, a new line body += &quot;&lt;tr&gt;&quot;; // td for each column of data body += &quot;&lt;td&gt;&quot; + row.name + &quot;&lt;/td&gt;&quot;; body += &quot;&lt;td&gt;&quot; + row.ghID + &quot;&lt;/td&gt;&quot;; body += &quot;&lt;td&gt;&quot; + row.role + &quot;&lt;/td&gt;&quot;; body += &quot;&lt;td&gt;&quot; + row.sport + &quot;&lt;/td&gt;&quot;; // tr to end line body += &quot;&lt;tr&gt;&quot;; } // Build and HTML fragment of div, table, table body return ( &quot;&lt;div style=&#39;&quot; + style + &quot;&#39;&gt;&quot; + &quot;&lt;table&gt;&quot; + body + &quot;&lt;/table&gt;&quot; + &quot;&lt;/div&gt;&quot; ); }; // IJavaScript HTML processor receive parameter of defined HTML fragment $$.html(compsci._toHtml()); .

Drafting: . For my code I used a simple repeating command “on event (“Button name”,”click”, function(){“ (This was used throughout my whole quiz) I wanted to create a question that requires them to type in the answer (code below) . onEvent(“enter”, “click”, function( ) { console.log(“answerbutton entered text: “ + getText(“text-input”)); if (getText(“text-input”) == “Ronaldo”) { setScreen(“end”); } else { setScreen(“incorrect”); } }); . Data Abstraction . An example of Data Abstraction in this program is the “font size” chart. It holds multiple selections that represent different sizes. A random number function takes a random size selection from the list and sets the default font size to that selection. . The point . The point of the assignment was to get comfortable with code.org but specifically java script. . # Managing Complexity . An example of complexity management in this quiz is the layout. The quiz is divided into two parts: pasword and exploration in the program. This can easily be seen in the first part of the code, each command has its own defined function. . Challenges . Since I created a Jeopardy game there were lots of buttons that I had to create so I had to make sure the names were correct, so I could easily find them, I also had a little trouble while making a question with text entry. .",
